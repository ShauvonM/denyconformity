          'I&rsquo;ve been wondering where the line is when it comes to gender representation. Is it appropriate for male creators to create female characters? Is it appropriate for male creators to express a point of view or a statement about life as a woman? Certainly under some circumstances the answer is yes. However, I believe there are circumstances where the answer is definitely not yes. I wonder if things can cross a line into something that we might consider "Gender Appropriation."\r\n\r\nAllow me to introduce you to a video game called *Bayonetta*.\r\n\r\nOkay, I know that video games in general are already extremely un-diverse, and the entire video game industry is fundamentally founded upon sexism. Describing a big budget video game in the context of feminism is very much starting off on the wrong foot. It&rsquo;s just that this is a really powerful example of something that concerns me.\r\n\r\n![Box art for the first Bayonetta game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/Bayonetta_box_artwork.png)\r\n> Here&rsquo;s the box art for the first game.\r\n\r\nIn the video game called *Bayonetta*, you play as the titular character called &ldquo;Bayonetta&rdquo; - a witch who did something or other to upset God and has to fight her way through hordes of angelic demons in a mostly brown world full of muddled symbolism and awkward cultural references. I think. The specifics aren&rsquo;t super important. Also the storytelling is almost completely incoherent. I&rsquo;m not an Anime Person, and I suspect *Bayonetta* is thick with anime tropes, so I&rsquo;m just going to chalk it up to my personal ignorance of the subject and not pass any judgements on something that isn&rsquo;t really My Thing. I&rsquo;ll let you read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta) for it if you want to know about the plot. I think I&rsquo;m pretty safe at least in calling it completely bizarre, as I believe that&rsquo;s the point.\r\n\r\nI also won&rsquo;t really discuss the gameplay, which is very much not My Thing either. It seems like it&rsquo;s pretty similar to games like *Devil May Cry* (which was made by the same company) or perhaps a similar genre to something like those new Batman games. You run around in a mostly linear level, and every room you enter gets locked until you beat up the assortment of enemies placed in it. Combat is purely based on mastering a series of complicated button combinations. Occasionally you find a giant monster boss and fight it in a very Cinematic^TM way which basically amounts to watching a video of cartoon characters punching each other while you wait for it to tell you to push a button at the right time.\r\n\r\nPlenty of people like the gameplay and I&rsquo;m sure they get something from the plot. Just because I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t make it invalid for those who do, so that&rsquo;s *fine*. I will say that I have played both games, though not to completion. The common response to feminist discussions of Bayonetta seem to be *[have you actually played it?](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/521788400538370048)* so I figured I should disclose that. Perhaps one cannot discuss the context, relevance, and message of a work unless they have experienced it in totality, but I think it&rsquo;s possible to have not seen every single moment of the game and still have thoughts about it.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to focus on is that titular main character, how she is portrayed, and the person or people who created her. Maybe I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; her either. Maybe she is totally *fine* too.\r\n\r\nSo just off the bat, here&rsquo;s what she looks like:\r\n\r\n![Bayonetta, the character, from *Bayonetta* the game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/Bayonetta-2-High.jpg)\r\n> This is an in-game screenshot. For the record, it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a picture of her that isn&rsquo;t of her butt.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll try to describe her as objectively as possible (feel free to add "for some reason" to the end of every sentence here). She is unnaturally tall and thin. She wears an all black skintight outfit with incredibly frilly sleeves and cutouts for her cleavage and her entire back. She wears eight inch stiletto heels which also happen to be guns, and a librarian&rsquo;s glasses which she has to constantly push up but which somehow never fall off despite the fact she is upside-down roughly 45% of the time. In addition to her shoes, she also carries a gun in each hand - all four have infinite bullets which do way less damage than when she kicks things.\r\n\r\nShe has superpowers that revolve around her hair, which her outfit is also made of. The stronger her attacks, the more of her hair is used, which means more of her outfit is removed. There is no in-game reason for this, but I think the out-of-game reason is pretty obvious.\r\n\r\n![A climax move in the first game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/5aa8d53e09583666daec85e1_2018022814070000-39044917CFF4239A6A8855A4FBFD24A3.jpg)\r\n> Here she can be seen committing one of the game&rsquo;s finishing moves, called a &ldquo;climax.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe is intentionally hyper-sexualized, and the game makes no apologies for that. The camera sweeps over her butt at any opportunity. Every attack results in her posing luridly with her legs spread and her body on display for the player. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a cutscene in either game that doesn&rsquo;t have her winking suggestively at the camera. Her powerups and health pickups are in the form of lollipops, which she playfully sucks on with a confident swagger. \r\n\r\n![A very common sight in Bayonetta](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/bayonetta-1-2-wiiu-1.jpg)\r\n> Here she can be seen doing a pretty standard attack in the game.\r\n\r\nHer more powerful attacks result in her being completely stripped naked, looking straight at the camera in a pornographic pose, apparently breaking the third-wall in acknowledgement of exactly why she exists. *I know what you&rsquo;re here for,* she winks at you, *and I&rsquo;m more than happy to deliver with a flourish.* This isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;prudish&rdquo; Lara Croft - a comparison made by one reviewer when the first game came out.\r\n\r\n![Finally a female character who will show me what I, a 14 year old boy, want to see](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/460790_screenshots_20181010213434_1.jpg)\r\n>Presented without comment.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, apparently Lara is a prude for having the audacity to not strip naked for the player (despite the numerous rumors that 12 year old boys like to pass around about the Tomb Raider games).\r\n\r\nBayonetta makes jokes (at least, the way certain lines are written are clearly meant to be jokes, despite how funny you might actually find them). She makes fun of other characters. She&rsquo;s ridiculous, to an extreme. Perhaps she&rsquo;s just camp? A sort of satire on sexualized characters in general?\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with self-actualized hyper-sexualized characters. Sex exsits, humans are sexual beings, and women are entitled to express their sexuality as much as anybody else. I believe that there are folks who are empowered and inspired by Bayonetta&rsquo;s unapologetic sexuality. Also, as someone who has a fascination with witches, obviously the idea of a witch who shoots demons with her feet does pique my interest.\r\n\r\n![A totally normal sight.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/s3-7ea3a303bd62d9ba67565b803b1fb4d1.jpg)\r\n>I mean fair enough, she&rsquo;s not the only completely bizarre aspect of these games.\r\n\r\nBut here&rsquo;s the thing.\r\n\r\nWho is making her do these things? The character design *is* credited to a woman - Mari Shimazaki. She went through thousands of iterations with the game&rsquo;s creators to capture their vision, and she certainly expressed her own interpretation of femininity in the character. I don&rsquo;t want to discredit her creative contributions, but I&rsquo;m quite sure that a number of the character&rsquo;s design decisions were not hers. She was absolutely implementing *their* vision. Other than that one designer and the character&rsquo;s voice actress, everyone else involved with the game is male, including the director, writers, producers, modelers, animators, and designers. I dare say most of the players, as well. The pen which drew some concept art might have been held by a woman, but this character is a male creation.\r\n\r\n![Female empowerment?](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/s12-5d186bc0f68f45859c892bf0fd3387bc.jpg)\r\n>Is this female empowerment?\r\n\r\nThe series creator, Hideki Kamiya, referred to the final design for Bayonetta as his &ldquo;ideal woman.&rdquo; About giving her glasses, the designer admitted that it was &ldquo;possibly [Kamiya&rsquo;s] preference for women with glasses.&rdquo; If she was intended to be hyper-sexualized, she was clearly intended to be a man&rsquo;s fantasy-fulfillment, too.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot from Bayonetta 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/5aa8d5ff04a9ce99e4940f54_2018030221550500-E27E5ADA5A86332E7C52B3562FCF5A27.jpg)\r\n>She has a shorter haircut in the second game, which is clearly the element they meant to showcase in this screenshot.\r\n\r\nSo here&rsquo;s the real question - is this okay?\r\n\r\nObviously men should be able to create female characters, and perhaps even sexualize those characters. However, *Bayonetta* the game isn&rsquo;t just portraying a female character - it&rsquo;s making a statement. Whether intentionally or not, these games are normalizing the idea of a woman being overt with her sexuality. Is that an argument that a man should be able to make? __Women are totally allowed to be sexual, but are men entitled to be sexual on their behalf?__\r\n\r\nThe games are extremely highly regarded, for the record. They&rsquo;ve been referred to as masterpieces, with the character being propped up as one of the &ldquo;greatest of all time.&rdquo; As I said, it&rsquo;s not My Thing, but it&rsquo;s clearly a lot of Peoples&rsquo; Thing, and they are able, either willingly or ignorantly, to ignore or rationalize the questionable aspects of the game because they find it fun to play.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the &ldquo;greatest of all time&rdquo; - if we&rsquo;re talking about female characters, Bayonetta certainly isn&rsquo;t the first to be created by men. The fact is that most female characters - even the ones you might think of as totally unproblematic feminist figureheads - were probably created by men, too. Looking through the [List of female action heroes and villains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_action_heroes_and_villains) page on Wikipedia only comes up with a (Count Rugen) handful actually created by women - Anna and Elsa from *Frozen*, Merida from *Brave*, Trinity from the *Matrix* films, Katniss Everdeen, and Hermione Granger. Who made the rest? Men.\r\n\r\nTake Wonder Woman, for example. It&rsquo;s widely acknowledged that her creator, \t\r\nWilliam Moulton Marston, created her as an expression of his interest in bondage and general fetishization of powerful women. Wonder Woman, then, is just as much of a male fantasy fulfillment as Bayonetta. She was pretty heavily sexualized, too. Sure, she wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;gets naked when she attacks things&rdquo; sexualized. She was pretty riske for the 40&rsquo;s, though, and I know Linda Carter&rsquo;s outfit caused a bit of a stir in her Wonder Woman TV show in the 70&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s almost always written and/or drawn by men, largely because the comics industry - just like video games - is dominated by male writers and artists.\r\n\r\n![An actual panel from a Wonder Woman comic for kids.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/2017-02-15-07.43.10.png)\r\n> Cool cool.\r\n\r\nWonder Woman has (pretty much) always been at least on some level about the empowerment of women.  It\'s empowerment by male standards and male benchmarks, though. It\'s men saying, "this is what you should aspire to be," not women saying "this is I want to be." Maybe it fits both questions, for at least some people. One woman\'s ideal won\'t match another\'s, no matter who described it. Does the *Bayonetta* question apply to Wonder Woman? __Women are totally allowed to feel empowered, but are men entitled to empower women on their behalf?__ Is there a moral difference between men empowering women and sexualizing them, especially when the core goal of that representation is to entertain a largely male audience?\r\n\r\nAt what point is it no longer acceptable for a man to make a woman - even a fictional one - do something for his enjoyment?\r\n\r\nFor the record, I thought about including some links to &ldquo;additional reading&rdquo; on the subject of Bayonetta and female representation, but you can Google those things as easily as I can. If you&rsquo;re interested in this subject, I encourage you to. If you would like a copy of *Bayonetta 2* on the Switch so you can properly make comments about it on Twitter, I could send you mine.',

          'Terry sighed softly to himself. He waited. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\nThe thing about Humans is they have a lot of problems. They tend to gather them, the way a large dog tromping noisily through a forest will gather burrs, funny little leaves, bugs, and small sticks. A Human would probably clear-cut that forest and build a shopping mall where it was, and then probably cite that as a reason they are superior to the average dog. The dog mostly just thinks about Ball, or Food, or Lady. At the end of the day, that shopping mall will just bring the human even more problems. The only problems the dog has are some burrs to wrestle out of its fur, which is actually kind of a fun game, and they&rsquo;re kind of like Ball a little bit when you think about it, and maybe there will be Food soon, and hey look at that funny little leaf.\r\n\r\nThe point is that problems tend to follow humans around. Most of the problems are their own doing, but in a cosmic sense, it&rsquo;s hard to really draw a line between problems caused by people, and problems caused *at* them. To the people with the problems, it hardly makes a difference. Problems are problems.\r\n\r\nFor Terry, this fact wasn&rsquo;t really top of mind. He didn&rsquo;t really understand the nature of human problems. Terry was a dog.\r\n\r\nHe didn&rsquo;t think too much about Ball anymore, and he was not likely to be seen doing much that would resemble tromping. This is because he was a very ancient dog, the sort that seems to resemble something more like a large, smelly rug than a housepet. Ball is a young dog&rsquo;s worry. Terry was a mutt, a mixture of breeds so diverse he looked like someone had thrown one of every dog into a big blender and then sculpted the resulting genetic masala into a greyish brown pile with some floppy ears and four massive mits. He spent most of his time flattened out, spreading slowly like a pile of fuzzy molasses, on different floors. He liked floors - they were always there for him when he needed them.\r\n\r\nOne night Terry was waiting, rug like, on the floor of a quaint but well stocked little kitchen in the center of a cozy home. He had slowly collected himself and grumbled his way to the kitchen in honor of his long standing duty to his Lady. It was an important job, watching over the things his Lady created in the oven. He did not understand why it must be done, but that was the sort of thing that dog does not question. All he knew was that it was his job to do.\r\n\r\nIn his hundreds of dog years, he never once got a chance to sample any of the rather delicious-smelling things that his Lady liked to keep in that funny warm box. Still, he dutifully stood (and as he got older, rugged) watch over the treats just in case after all this time she might finally remember his presence and deign to reward his diligence with a bite. He did not understand that pies, cakes, and pastries were not the sort of thing that dogs should eat. Sometimes Lady baked little bone-shaped things that became delightfully crunchy when they cooled, but that&rsquo;s different. He could smell it. He didn&rsquo;t understand the difference, but it was apparent. That was the sort of thing a dog does not question. He was there to serve his Lady.\r\n\r\nHis Lady was currently sitting nearby, with two other, lesser, Ladies. He knew she was better than them, because she was his, and so she didn&rsquo;t cease to exist quite as often as the others did. Also, she was the source of Food, and sometimes Cuddle. Terry was not too proud to admit his fondness for a good Cuddle.\r\n\r\nBut this isn&rsquo;t a story about a dog. This is a story about problems.\r\n\r\nThose three women sitting around the ancient dinner table always had a number of problems. They were humans - at least on paper - so of course their lives were a series of problems punctuated with an occasional sleep. However, the thing which set these women apart from other humans was that they were witches. Witches are problem solvers.\r\n\r\nThe sort of problems that witches usually solve are not always common, everyday problems.  Witch Problems are usually very much not the sort of problems Normal People face. Sometimes Witch Problems were not terribly different from the problems of the average dog, considering the amount of tromping around in forests the Craft often requires. Witch Problems are often mysterious. Witch Problems are often imaginary. This should not discount their importance, of course. It&rsquo;s complicated, being a Witch.\r\n\r\nTerry&rsquo;s lady was called Clarinda. Her colleagues were Agnes and Lilith. They were also known - depending on who you asked - as the Defenders of the Plane of Awareness, Guardians of the Staff of Death, or simply the Witches of Puget Sound and the Greater Vancouver area (when they make it up that way). They sat around a quaint, roomy table mulling over their latest problem. It was one of Purpose, and of Function. They were trying to understand their role in the latest iteration of this ever-changing world. It was, however, growing increasingly difficult to stay focused as the room filled with the aroma of pie.\r\n\r\nClarinda pushed herself up from her chair and walked to the kitchen with a great purpose. She had a sort of preternatural sense for when baked goods were ready. It grew from decades of experience in the grand tradition of the home baker. She had through her long life developed a sort of cosmic awareness of the nature of crust. The gluten spoke to her.\r\n\r\nShe stepped over the seemingly lifeless body of Terry, the ancient mutt who was her loyalest companion in the whole wide world. Like his mistress, he had also spent (dog) decades playing the important but underappreciated role of Baker&rsquo;s Companion. Through a great force of will and the expenditure of a frustrating amount of energy, he lifted his head from the floor, folds of skin and floppy ears following a moment later. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\nClarinda fetched her dog-shaped oven mitt, and retrieved the golden, steaming treat from the stovetop, where it had just achieved the perfect temperature for consumption. She smiled pleasantly to herself, admiring her work. The pie was topped with a lattice, woven into a rather artful and evocative shape with floral designs around the outside. The lattice gave peeks at the tart, gooey apple mixture inside. This was real magic - instantly irresistible, and plainly apparent. One could not behold this creation without immediately developing a pavlovian response. \r\n\r\nClarinda brought the pie to the table, placing it at the center to be beheld. Terry returned his head to the floor, his noble duty fulfilled once again.\r\n\r\nLilith rolled her eyes, as Clarinda had predicted she would, and Agnes burst into laughter. The lattice atop the pie was laid out in a rather unmistakably yonic shape.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So childish,&rdquo; Lilith said, a subtle smirk belying her amusement.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You say that like it&rsquo;s a bad thing.&rdquo; Asked Agnes, peering over the steaming perfection and licking her lips.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Getting mixed feelings?&rdquo; Asked Clarinda, turning the pie to face Lilith.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About one of your pies?&rdquo; Lilith responded. &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Agnes, hoping that by getting the plates ready she would be speeding the process of slicing and serving. &ldquo;There are so many phallic foods. It&rsquo;s about time we got some representation.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think pies should look like pies,&rdquo; Lilith said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I spent many years thinking that way - that everything should be perfect,&rdquo; Clarinda said, bringing a knife to the pie. The sharp blade stabbed right at the center of the confectionary vulva.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yikes,&rdquo; Agnes said, wincing. It was a rather visceral sight.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;&lsquo;Everything has its place,&rsquo; I thought,&rdquo; Clarinda continued, slicing the pie for each of them. &ldquo;There is a right way and a wrong way. Pies must look like pies, and so forth.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe expertly placed three perfect slices of yonic apple pie onto plates. Two sets of eyes were glued to them, and Clarinda knew it. Nothing focuses the minds of a group like a good pie. Clarinda was the oldest of the three, but by a largely trivial amount. Age is not an important metric for a witch. A few years of seniority begins to feel insignificant, when you realize you can tap into great cosmic forces and potentially live for thousands. Still, Clarinda played the part of the old, wise grandmother so well the others just generally went along with it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That is entirely based on a falsehood, though,&rdquo; Clarinda continued. &ldquo;I assumed that the universe operated on rules. That there is a rhyme or reason to anything. We all know that isn&rsquo;t true. The first thing we learn about the Craft is-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Lilith interrupted, waving her hand in as respectfully a way as one could possibly do. &ldquo;&lsquo;Reality is what we make of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well I choose to make vulva pie,&rdquo; Clarinda concluded, smiling sweetly. She had the sort of sweet smile that would make mortal enemies stop for a moment mid-combat and realize they haven&rsquo;t talked to their mothers in a while. While Lilith had spent decades practicing being terrifying, Clarinda was working on the opposite.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, for one, completely agree,&rdquo; said Agnes, looking at the other two somewhat annoyed. &ldquo;So can I have some pie while the two of you talk?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes could always diffuse the tension in the room. Her magical ability was always the weakest of the three, and she rarely took anything seriously. That was her real power, though. She was like a cat who could find comfort anywhere. Agnes had never met a situation she couldn&rsquo;t have fun with. She grew up in some manner of poverty in Estonia, and had to quickly learn how to adapt to uncomfortable situations.\r\n\r\nClarinda handed out the plates. Agnes tucked into hers immediately, with a satisfied moan. Clarinda held Lilith&rsquo;s plate before her, looking at her friend with her disarming smile.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Would you like a slice of my vulva, Lili?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask,&rdquo; replied Lilith.\r\n\r\nLilith often reflected to herself that she had the hardest job of their little triad. Agnes, as the youngest of them, never took anything seriously because she never needed to. Clarinda, the Mother, got to be the nice one. Anyone can be nice or silly, Lilith thought. It took real skill to be wicked. Not many Witches would readily volunteer to be the Crone and pull it off with such grace and (not that it needs to be called out) beauty. She raised the standard for the noble legacy of the Wicked Witch. She would never mention it, of course, but it would be nice for someone else to.\r\n\r\nLittle conversation happened while the pie was consumed. The calm silence was punctuated by forks clanking against plates, the groaning from the rug on the kitchen floor, and the occasional muttered Estonian expletive as Agnes enjoyed each mouthful more than the last.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lilith could not let the conversation go unfinished. She returned to the topic at hand.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So what do you propose we do, then?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Asked Clarinda.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Lilith responded incredulously. &ldquo;About us. About the world. About our futures. You two may not care about anything-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Woah, hey,&rdquo; Agnes interrupted, her brow furrowed. &ldquo;I care very much about anything.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But I,&rdquo; continued Lilith, undeterred, &ldquo;am very concerned about how we are going to continue to survive. We are in a world that seems to be less in need of our services by the day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So we find new services,&rdquo; Agnes chimed in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it before. Remember when the midwifery work got complicated? That&rsquo;s when we sold herbs and tinctures. Later, I started my Yoga practice. Then when people got bored with Yoga, I found Etsy.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Clarinda said, &ldquo;we always adapt. Times are always changing.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Have you noticed how even though things are always changing,&rdquo; Agnes said absently, licking the last few crumbs of pie from her plate, &ldquo;but everybody always thinks this is the Big One?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Take any moment in human history. I bet you everybody living there thinks that the world is totally turning on its head and everything good about life is disappearing. No matter when you look, their &lsquo;now&rsquo; is new and scary, and their &lsquo;then&rsquo; was when things really worked. I bet even the first Humans - you know, those strange mutated apes? They probably pissed off their parents by daring to walk upright and dream of wearing pants. They probably had the same thoughts. They probably talked about how great it was when their brains were smaller and they had hairier knuckles. &lsquo;Kids these days don&rsquo;t realize what living in a cave is really all about.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith was unswayed.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nothing is forever,&rdquo; Lilith said. &ldquo;Not even us.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Clarinda. &ldquo;But why should we fret about inevitabilities?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Agnes again. She felt strange having to always be the realist in a conversation with two Witches. &ldquo;Are we or are we not responsible for defending this plane of existence from hordes of evil who would try to destroy it?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; confirmed Clarinda. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So as long as said evil hordes continue existing,&rdquo; Agnes continued. &ldquo;Is there not a reason for us to still be around? This world still needs us, right? Just like throughout history, the world needs Witches.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Lilith, &ldquo;but this world has an important distinction from the world of our Foremothers.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have to pay bills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes had to concede that one.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The rent in my shop is going up again this year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The trouble with being secret defenders of existential planes is the lack of recognition. I mean sheesh, you&rsquo;d think we could at least get a key to the city or something.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Times change,&rdquo; said Lilith. &ldquo;So I say we should change, too. Not just adapting to the world around us, but actually stepping up to take matters into our own hands.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe other two stopped for a moment to consider this.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; Agnes argued, &ldquo;we can start selling potions and stuff online. There&rsquo;s tons of this stuff out there. People are forking over big bushels of money for stuff that doesn&rsquo;t even work. Imagine if it did!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Clarinda said gently. &ldquo;People won&rsquo;t be able to accept that. Magic doesn&rsquo;t work over mail-order.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t email a spell,&rdquo; Lilith said. She had tried.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sisters,&rdquo; Lilith continued, shrugging off Agnes&rsquo; idea. &ldquo;There is a storm coming. Can you not feel it? The winds of change are blowing harder than ever.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith had a way of bringing the lights down in a room. Agnes always thought that was neat, and leaned on her elbows, watching Lilith&rsquo;s intensity with a grin. Clarinda leaned back in her chair, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have weathered storms before,&rdquo; she said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But we will not forever. A storm will come that will break even the Great Clarinda.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what can I do in the face of such inevitability?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Break the storm.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ooh,&rdquo; said Agnes, fanning her face with her hand. &ldquo;Chills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Clarinda, what happens when we canot do this anymore?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We stop, of course.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But then what happens to the world?&rdquo; Agnes asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It cannot be left unguarded,&rdquo; Clarinda conceded.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Lilith, her eyebrows raising passionately. &ldquo;Consider, sisters, that this world is growing less and less isolated. It is no longer serving us to stay isolated ourselves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; Agnes retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault you don&rsquo;t understand how the Internet works.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you really suggesting that we go public?&rdquo; Clarinda asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course not, we all know that isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; Lilith responded.\r\n\r\nThe forces that one might call &lsquo;Magic&rsquo; are complicated things. Witches don&rsquo;t presume to understand them any better than anyone else. In fact, if anything, Witches understand it even less. A Witch truly understands that they know even less than someone who doesn&rsquo;t even know how little they know. If you think that was confusing, that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Magic is full of weird stuff like that. It&rsquo;s no wonder all of the devotees end up so eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor example, every Witch knows that the Craft cannot be conferred to another. A Witch can&rsquo;t just go up to some young lady and ask, &lsquo;hey, do you want to learn how to really creep out boys and make weird teas?&rsquo; No matter how much they might be onboard, their mind just won&rsquo;t be open to it. Nothing will stick. A prospective Witch has to open the door herself. Nobody else can do it for you. It&rsquo;s like the opposite of tickling.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But we can get help,&rdquo; Lilith continued. &ldquo;We need not be three forever.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Clarinda said simply.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now, look,&rdquo; Agnes said sharply, fully prepared to mediate the argument. &ldquo;Wait, what? You agree?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes wasn&rsquo;t used to her two sisters agreeing on much.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Clarinda. &ldquo;I do believe it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How are we going to find new recruits?&rdquo; Asked Agnes. &ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s this web site called The Face Book, and-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ugh, we know about Facebook,&rdquo; said Lilith.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And I believe everyone has already moved on,&rdquo; Clarinda chimed in.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Right. I knew that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our replacements will find their way to us,&rdquo; Lilith continued. &ldquo;We all know that. That is how It works. We can&rsquo;t seek them out. The Universe must continue as it wills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; Clarinda said, looking thoughtfully at nothing in particular, &ldquo;the Powers of the Universe don&rsquo;t agree with us, though. Don&rsquo;t you think They will ensure that events transpire the way the Universe requires, *when* the Universe requires?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think They expect us to look out for ourselves,&rdquo; Lilith rebuked. &ldquo;If They had that much control, They wouldn&rsquo;t need us.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe thing about Humans is they like to think they&rsquo;re the top of the food chain. The more thoughtful folks, like Witches, knew this logically didn&rsquo;t make sense. There are forces that are higher than Humans - there have to be. Just like a Dog cannot comprehend the inner workings of his Lady, a Human can&rsquo;t begin to fathom the motivations of Time, or Death. It only makes sense that there are powers beyond human comprehension entirely. God? Perhaps, though most witches prefer picturing a rather more diverse pantheon. When you&rsquo;re just making stuff up, a witch might say, it seems pretty unimaginative to think there&rsquo;s just some white man up there all by Himself. Who would be cleaning up after Him?\r\n\r\nSo a witch might occasionally make comments about a mysterious &ldquo;They,&rdquo; questioning Their real power. If They really X, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean Y? It was more of a challenge than a question. It&rsquo;s a grasping at straws. Maybe if you say something that strikes a nerve, They&rsquo;ll finally do something about it. Then you&rsquo;ll at least have something to go on.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is the quick pause of silence that often follows an open challenge of a God&rsquo;s power, as the mere mortals waited for the confirmation or denial of that challenge. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Agnes said, cutting the existential tension. &ldquo;Faith would be so much easier if Gods would just tell us whether they exist or not.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So in the absence of context,&rdquo; Clarinda said, resignedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to make decisions based on nothing but the context we have.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith just sat back and let the snowball she had started continue its trajectory down the hill.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Okay, so we can&rsquo;t recruit,&rdquo; Agnes said. &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t we, perhaps, put out some breadcrumbs?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; Clarinda continued, staring at the remaining three quarters of her pie, &ldquo;we found someone. Perhaps a few someones. Suppose we planted seeds in their path; gave them knowledge they would need to open the door themselves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes thought for a moment, and gave her sisters a sly look.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But wherever will we find women who want to have more power in their lives?&rdquo;',

      'text':
          'They were lucky. The protest stayed mostly non-violent. There were some scuffles, some bad folks - on both sides! - tried to instigate some trouble. At the end of the tense day, cooler heads had prevailed. Nobody was seriously hurt, and property damage was kept in the double digits.\r\n\r\nLiberty was particularly lucky that day, but she didn&rsquo;t really understand the scope of her luck until much, much later.\r\n\r\nShe marched with the main group. She hadn&rsquo;t prepared a sign, due to time constraints, but her voice was heard. She always made her voice heard. She was decked out, to the nines (as it were), and felt like she was at the pinnacle of her witchy, badass power. Her freshly-dyed bright blue pixie cut shone in the sunlight, and she felt her thick eyeliner made her look tough. She was excited it wasn&rsquo;t too warm, and she could wear her punk leather jacket covered in her favorite pins without getting too uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she wasn&rsquo;t comfortable admitting to herself that she was having fun, given the emotionally charged nature of the protest. However, she was. It was a beautiful day, she was surrounded by like-minded people, and everyone was staying safe.\r\n\r\nUntil they weren&rsquo;t anymore.\r\n\r\nIt started small - nobody really even knew where. Like a wildfire it spread quickly. Chaos took over, panic and fear was his allies, and confusion did the rest. Raised voices gave way to yells, which took on a dangerous edge. These weren&rsquo;t the normal yells of chants or protest. These were becoming the angry screams of riot. These were the sort of screams that took over a protest and turned it into a mob.\r\n\r\nLiberty was too close. She was swept into it. She tried to make her voice heard. She tried screaming things like &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and &ldquo;be cool&rdquo; but her voice just added to the chaos. Nobody was trying to escalate, at least as far as anyone would admit later, but tensions were too high not to boil over. Something was thrown - Liberty could feel it rushing over her head - and then the next thing she knew she was covering her face as pepper-spray rained down. The chaotic moment climaxed in a new chorus of screams.\r\n\r\nWrists were tied, protestors - perpetrators as well as innocent, unfortunate bystanders - were lined up, and first aid was administered. Liberty didn&rsquo;t get the brunt of the spray, so she was able to regain her awareness rather quickly. Her black eyeliner had run, giving her eyes permanent black tears. She found herself in a lineup on the sidewalk near where the chaos broke out, as officers tried to make sense of things.\r\n\r\nScanning the line of kneeling protestors, her eyes landed on the woman kneeling beside her. She was loudly breathing, her eyes irritated so much she clearly couldn&rsquo;t see. She was in her mid twenties and smartly dressed, at least for a public protest. What struck Liberty was the look on her face - despite the clearly painful irritation, she just looked sad.  Defeated.\r\n\r\nLiberty tried to lighten the mood. She nudged the woman gently with her shoulder, shrugging against the zip tie holding her wrists behind her.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Know any good lawyers?&rdquo; She asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; The woman said, turning in Liberty&rsquo;s direction. She quirked her eyebrows, which wasn&rsquo;t easy to do with all the irritation surrounding her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, heh, yeah, I know a couple.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Asked Liberty, feeling the ice had broken a little. &ldquo;Do you need anything?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m sure it looks worse than it is.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It looks pretty bad,&rdquo; Liberty said lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give you a comforting pat on the shoulder but,&rdquo; She indicated her wrists strapped together behind her. Liberty realized that she was gesturing for no reason. &ldquo;Can you . . . see?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Justice is blind,&rdquo; the woman replied with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You clearly got it worse than I did.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I take it you aren&rsquo;t black?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty blushed. She didn&rsquo;t know how to answer that one. Of course, the answers were obvious, but they were difficult to say.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the woman continued, sensing Liberty&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I suppose I should thank you for coming out.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I . . . don&rsquo;t think you need to,&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry things got out of hand.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your fault either,&rdquo; the woman responded. &ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m assuming you don&rsquo;t seem like the sort to start throwing stuff.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, you really can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Liberty joked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually a seven foot tall dude with, like *huge* arms.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well you have the voice of an angel,&rdquo; the woman joked back.\r\n\r\nLiberty blushed again, letting out a nervous giggle.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; the woman said, trying to scratch her face against her shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m missing much.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, there was the whole herd of giraffes that just walked by…&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Aw, man,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Just my luck. Giraffes are my favorite animal.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;Have you seen Giraffe babies? Their legs are like -&rdquo; She stopped and looked at the woman carefully. &ldquo;Wait, are you, like, actually blind?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just like to cosplay sometimes.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Liberty said, relaxing a bit. &ldquo;I mean, I didn&rsquo;t want to offend you. I knew a blind person once, and he normally was cool with saying stuff like &lsquo;have you seen this thing?&rsquo; But you never know...&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real talker, huh?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, yeah,&rdquo; Liberty blushed again. &ldquo;I talk when I&rsquo;m nervous, I guess. This is my first time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Mine too.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wanna be jail friends?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled softly, wondering who this strange person was.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sure. Jail friends.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Liberty,&rdquo; said Liberty.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Imani,&rdquo; replied Imani.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How do you shake hands with these things on?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to be patient, I guess.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThey knelt in silence for a few moments. Liberty watched the officers mill about, and felt strangely peaceful in the warm sun. She watched as an officer took statements from some people. Imani just stared at nothing, trying not to think about her eyes at all.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re going to get in trouble?&rdquo; Liberty asked nervously.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Imani responded. &ldquo;We might get taken to the courthouse or something, but they can&rsquo;t really charge us with much.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been arrested before…&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t being arrested, at least not yet. Nobody read us our rights.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;When do you think we&rsquo;ll be done here?&rdquo; Liberty asked. &ldquo;I kind of have a date tonight.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you think we made any difference?&rdquo; Liberty asked. &ldquo;I mean, was this pointless?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are we going to get sick, do you think?&rdquo; Liberty asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s going to get bad again.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA man in a suit was walking purposefully among the police officers. He had a cheap briefcase and the expression of someone who wasn&rsquo;t paid enough to justify the hours he put in. He found the sergeant, who seemed to be in charge, and started talking to him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Is that a lawyer or something?&rdquo; Liberty asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t . . . Oh, no,&rdquo; Imani replied, grimacing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get his attention.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Imani Fredrickson!&rdquo; The man called out, stepping away from the sergeant.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fuck me,&rdquo; Imani groaned. Liberty thought that somehow Imani&rsquo;s face got even redder.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Jesus Christ, they caught you up in this?&rdquo; The man said, standing a few feet away. &ldquo;What the Hell happened?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey Kevin,&rdquo; Imani. &ldquo;Just a misunderstanding.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Liberty said, looking up at the man with a confused look. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo; Imani said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Somebody, hey&rdquo; the man started saying, trying to catch the attention of one of the officers nearby. &ldquo;Come here, somebody release her.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers seemed reluctant.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Kevin,&rdquo; Imani pleaded, trying to keep her voice down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool, just let them do their jobs. Please don&rsquo;t make a big deal.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who is Kevin?&rdquo; Liberty whispered to Imani, watching the man cope with being generally ignored by everybody present. He seemed to be in his element.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a public defender,&rdquo; Imani responded.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And you know him because . . .?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one, too.&rdquo; She would have rolled her eyes if it hadn&rsquo;t caused her excruciating pain.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Liberty said, watching the public defender chase down one of the paramedics. &ldquo;So running into him now must be . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Excruciatingly embarrassing,&rdquo; Imani confirmed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nImani sighed as the cooling eyewash poured onto her face. Kevin grumbled, standing nearby. The paramedic silently worked, with apparently no consideration for how much of the eyewash was getting all over her outfit. The soothing sensation helped her relax a bit, but it did nothing for her embarrassment.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t have to do this,&rdquo; she was saying to the paramedic. &ldquo;Surely there&rsquo;s someone else who needs -&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nonsense, Imani,&rdquo; Kevin interrupted. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t even see.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Justice is blind…&rdquo; Liberty chimed in. She was there too, having followed the two of them since Kevin was finally able to convince an officer to let them go. Imani somehow felt calmer having her around. Hearing her voice was like a soft hug, which she definitely needed.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How did you get yourself arrested,&rdquo; Kevin asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; Liberty&rsquo;s voice chimed in again. &ldquo;But we weren&rsquo;t arrested!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Imani said, leaning her head back as her eyes slowly stopped burning.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But what were you thinking, Imani? You could have had your license revoked -&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know that, Kevin?&rdquo; Imani shot back. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m just out here rioting?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m just surprised to see you in handcuffs.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s more surprised than me,&rdquo; Imani said with a sigh. &ldquo;It just happened. I was nervous enough out here just protesting, and then all Hell broke loose.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; Liberty said, &ldquo;am surprised.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; Kevin asked, clearly not finding the other woman as charming as Imani did.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; Imani said, and then held up a hand to correct herself. &ldquo;Er, no . . . Liberty.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Jail Friends,&rdquo; Liberty said. Imani couldn&rsquo;t see Kevin&rsquo;s face, but she knew that he was furrowing his brow. He always did that when he didn&rsquo;t approve of something. He grumbled.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see if any charges are being filed against any of these kids - any of these *other* kids. You stay put and stay out of trouble.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani waved him off. The only thing that irritated her more than being caught up in this whole situation was having him there to rub her face in it. He meant well, in fact he was one of the kindest, most pure-hearted men Imani had ever met. Sometimes he tried to help a little too hard, though. She certainly didn&rsquo;t need him sticking his nose into her social life. It was hard enough for someone as busy as Imani to make friends.\r\n\r\nShe started thinking about this new friend of hers - this &ldquo;Jail Friend.&rdquo; Imani was really curious what she looked like - her only clue thus far was that she almost definitely wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;seven foot tall dude.&rdquo; She felt a connection, though. The kind of connection that doesn&rsquo;t come easily for a woman like Imani.\r\n\r\nShe tried opening her eyes, just a crack, to peek at her new friend. She managed to get as far as a bright light with a vaguely young-woman-shaped outline inside it before the pain got to be too much. She grimaced and reflexively reached her hand up to hold her eyes. The paramedic gently kept her from touching her face, which only would have made it worse.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You better not try to open your eyes just yet,&rdquo; he said calmly, putting some soft gauze pads over her left eye. Eventually she felt like she was taped up completely, just a big ball of gauze with a mouth.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You should probably leave these on for a few hours,&rdquo; he said, putting his tools away. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You kinda look like a fly,&rdquo; Liberty&rsquo;s voice joked once the paramedic finally left. &ldquo;If, you know, a fly had eyes made out of bandages.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Imani quipped back. &ldquo;Well, you look like a vague dark shape in a sea of painful brightness.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, you just happened to catch me on a good hair day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani felt her new friend sit on the curb next to her. The subtle clank implied some sort of bag chain or perhaps an impressive jacket with pins stuck in it. From Kevin&rsquo;s reaction, Imani got the sense that this young woman struck a rather notable silhouette. The voice was rather smooth, with a sharp edge of optimism. Imani suddenly found herself hoping her new friend wasn&rsquo;t much younger than her.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. Why was she so concerned about this woman?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I guess this is my life now,&rdquo; Imani said. She felt behind her back, checking for debris or other obstructions before leaning back on her hands.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Imani the human bandage fly,&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;Hey, I should take your picture - you can get some good Internet Points out of this.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; Imani cried, sitting up. She thought about blocking her face, but realized how stupid that would look if Liberty wasn&rsquo;t actually pointing a camera at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarrassed enough, I&rsquo;d rather not have evidence that this ever happened.\r\n\r\nKevin returned, which Imani realized because she could sense his dark cloud. Also he had an old man smell, and grumbled as he walked. She rested her chin in her hands, waiting for another lecture.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;looks like two kids are going to be charged with inciting.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe could tell he was looking around, trying not to share the news too loudly.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two guesses as to whether they&rsquo;re locals,&rdquo; he continued, grumpily. Cross-jurisdictional cases were always complicated, beyond just the moral implications of folks traveling into town just to start riots.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. Imani felt something awkwardly touch her hand - her ID. They had handed them over to the cops to get processed, although at the time she was hardly thinking straight.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My wallet?&rdquo; Imani asked the air in front of her. She felt strangely detached, as if she was just guessing as to what the world was like around her. She didn&rsquo;t like losing her ability to size people up. It was like swimming in the deep end of the pool - you just assume there&rsquo;s a bottom.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wallet?&rdquo; she heard Kevin ask. She sighed deeply, knowing it was yanked from her by the officers during the chaos.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Whelp,&rdquo; she said, feeling another layer of insult added to her injury.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Liberty said next to her. She heard a backpack or large bag unzip - a bit of clanking - and then a very soft hand touched hers.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I saw this get dropped when it was going down,&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;Is it yours?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani felt the familiar texture of her wallet, a small purple (fake) leather pocketbook. She let out an exhaultent gasp, and began checking the contents with her hands. The trouble is that all cards feel the same, but it seemed in order to her fingers. There were even some bills, not that she ever exactly knew how much cash she had in her wallet at any given time. She realized that was probably stupid walking into a public protest, but it was low on her list of things to be herself up about.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; she said with a huge sigh of relief. &ldquo;Thank you. I can&rsquo;t believe you found it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I guess we were just meant to meet,&rdquo; Liberty chuckled.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kevin interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to head back to the office. There&rsquo;s too much *youth* around here.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thanks for stopping by, Kevin,&rdquo; Imani said, hoping she could somehow get him to just leave it at that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I take you with me,&rdquo; he said, proving that he could not.\r\n\r\nImani could think of several deep, dark holes she wanted to crawl into. None of them included any of her colleagues, by design.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What I need,&rdquo; she said, itching under one of her bandages, &ldquo;is to get these things off my face and get myself home.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The boy said you have to wait a couple hours before you take them off,&rdquo; the soft voice next to Imani said. This news just made Imani groan. That felt like ages, when she felt like she was too busy to be doing any of this in the first place.\r\n\r\nAs if sensing her frustration, Liberty continued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! Since we didn&rsquo;t go to jail, I&rsquo;ll be your Bandage Buddy instead.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani laughed, despite herself. That unlocked something inside her, some awareness of the absurdity of the whole situation. Perhaps it was the giddy knowledge that things could have gone much worse, or the frustration over the futility of the whole thing. Whatever the case, she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from laughing. Liberty joined her, a melodic, delightful sound in her ear. Kevin did not.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Get out of here, Kevin,&rdquo; she said finally. Somehow she just assumed that Liberty was going to stay with her. &ldquo;My phone is at home, so I&rsquo;m not going anywhere until I go there.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe really hoped Liberty was old enough to drink.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Call me when you get home,&rdquo; Kevin said emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the office.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Imani replied. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath, ready for this all to be over. Knowing that Kevin had seen her, though, made her think it wouldn&rsquo;t be over for a while. She didn&rsquo;t like the fatherly relationship he had adopted around her. She knew it was his way, and he was a good mentor, but she knew these events wouldn&rsquo;t help her get out of that position any time soon.\r\n\r\nShe realized another danger.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Kevin?&rdquo; She called out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anybody about this.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA moment passed, full of awkward silence.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s . . . gone.&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAs it transpired, they passed the time incredibly quickly. They talked about absolutely nothing. Liberty, who crossed her legs and turned to face her new friend, brought giraffes back up, and that was that. They fell into the comfortable, casual banter of old friends.\r\n\r\nThey loved the same animals (giraffes, of course, as well as polar bears and penguins - they agreed that orangutans were the only ape worth mentioning). They shared the same sense of humor, laughing at stupid jokes and anecdotes about simpler times. They were technically strangers, but they had the same taste in candy, which certainly felt more important in the moment.\r\n\r\nEventually Liberty offered to escort Imani to her apartment, since it wasn&rsquo;t terribly far from where they were. It was an adventure in itself, as Liberty hooked Imani&rsquo;s arm - she had removed her leather coat at some point - and talked her through every step. It took longer than it needed to, because the two of them couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing at themselves. For a moment, Imani wasn&rsquo;t worried about anyone noticing her, and Liberty wasn&rsquo;t terrified about the impending end of the world.\r\n\r\nLiberty called Imani&rsquo;s building &lsquo;swanky&rsquo; which did not fill Imani with confidence about how old the other woman was. Imani patted herself on the back for putting her keys on a necklace. She pulled the key out of her bra, something she would normally have to do in private. Having her eyes covered made her feel like everything was private, in a strange way.\r\n\r\nImani thanked her friend for taking care of her. She couldn&rsquo;t believe how deeply she meant it. Liberty wasn&rsquo;t sure how to respond. She didn&rsquo;t generally know how to handle praise.\r\n\r\nImani blindly felt her way into her apartment and found where she left her phone. She patted herself on the back for being a generally very organized person. She needed to remind herself that she wasn&rsquo;t a complete idiot.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I should get going,&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this date later.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So, you should put yourself in my phone before you go,&rdquo; Imani said, handing the phone to the general direction of her front door. A hand took it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;In case you need a character witness?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I want to buy you lunch or something,&rdquo; Imani said. She felt herself blushing, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure why. Everything else felt so natural with Liberty, this was a strange formality. Her phone was handed back.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me anything,&rdquo; Liberty said. &ldquo;I mean, you got me off.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Uh, I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that,&rdquo; she added.\r\n\r\nImani laughed, and played coy. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Uh, no, I just,&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m, you know,&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Anyway, I should get going.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani nodded, reaching awkwardly for the door.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you so you can let me know when you get home safe,&rdquo; she said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How will you even read it?&rdquo; Liberty joked.\r\n\r\nLater, when the bandages were finally removed, Imani found Liberty&rsquo;s number in her phone. She had taken a selfie, so Imani could see what she looked like. Imani stared at the picture, a young woman in her twenties, making a silly face to cover up her awkwardness and throwing up a peace sign. Imani was happy and relieved that the woman wasn&rsquo;t a minor. \r\n\r\nThe entry in her contacts was listed under &ldquo;Jail Friend.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe left it that way for years.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLiberty felt a little special when she went to meet Imani for lunch a few days later. She knew what Imani looked like (at least with a great deal of irritation and closed eyes), but Imani didn\'t exactly know much about her. It felt like a sort of blind date, except that she already knew they got along really well.\r\n\r\nLiberty was always nervous around new people. She developed the instinct to make jokes after years of awkward interactions with strangers. At some point after college she had basically given up trying to make new friends. She didn\'t really get it.\r\n\r\nThat\'s what made Imani so special to her. From the moment they met - it felt like she met Imani more than Imani met her - Liberty just felt a connection. Maybe it was the nature of how they met. The shared trauma broke the ice. It was almost like how she felt with her best friends in school, over a decade ago. They liked the same toys, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nShe figured that was more than enough.\r\n\r\nShe tried playing it cool when she approached the table outside the little cafe in town. She was going to stay aloof, and see if Imani would recognize her. However, when she saw her new friend she just couldn\'t help but smile. Imani was so much more radiant, so much happier. It made her heart warm.\r\n\r\nImani beamed at her, recognizing her from the selfie on her phone. It wasn\'t that it was that good of a picture, it\'s just easy to pick out the woman with bright blue hair.\r\n\r\nImani was dressed professionally, with a white blouse under a cardigan. It made Liberty feel a bit out of place. She wasn\'t sure what one wear to go see a friend as an adult, so she just dressed casually. Her simple denim blue button-up and her colorful leggings under cutoff jean shorts contrasted from the professional sitting opposite her. \r\n\r\nThe nervousness went away as soon as Imani spoke, though.\r\n\r\n"Okay," she said, dispensing with the pleasantries. It was as if she was asking the most important question, something she simply had to get off her chest. "Best animal documentary?"\r\n\r\nLiberty laughed, feeling comfortable immediately.\r\n\r\n"Orangutan Jungle School," she answered quickly. It was an easy one.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen it."\r\n\r\n"Oh my God," Liberty exclaimed, grabbing the sides of the table. "I\'m making you watch it."\r\n\r\nImani smirked, and then her face opened up in another bright smile. Liberty was struck by how incredibly breathtaking Imani\'s eyes were. She hadn\'t seen them before. She almost said "wow" out loud, but managed to stop herself.\r\n\r\n"Lunch is on me," Imani reiterated, waving off any potential protests. Liberty didn\'t have any - she just felt like she understood that the next one would be on her.\r\n\r\nThey ate slowly, losing track of the time.\r\n\r\nEventually Imani realized that she had spent a bit too long on her lunch break.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Agh,&rdquo; she groaned, looking at her phone. &ldquo;So many emails. I should get back to work.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Liberty replied, realizing she had finished eating a long time ago.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So, um . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, thanks, uh . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, I guess . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Right, have a good, you know, rest of your day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You too.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIt wasn&rsquo;t until their third or fourth time together that Imani finally asked Liberty what she did for a living. She suspected it was something creative, or perhaps technical - she didn&rsquo;t seem like the sort to work in an office. Aside from being a little jealous of Liberty&rsquo;s clearly very manageable hair, Imani enjoyed basking in the sense of freedom that she got from her friend. Liberty just seemed to let things roll off her back.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a vet tech,&rdquo; Liberty said, sipping the beer that Imani had bought for them to share.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ah, that explains your love of animals,&rdquo; Imani replied.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m a bit of a cliche.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty went on to explain that she had always wanted to be a vet, but couldn&rsquo;t quite make it through school well enough for more than an associate&rsquo;s degree.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It was too stressful,&rdquo; Liberty said, looking at the bottle in her hand.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That surprises me,&rdquo; Imani said. &ldquo;You seem so calm and collected.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s news to me,&rdquo; Liberty laughed. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m just good at faking it. Maybe I should have gone into theater.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You really could have fooled me,&rdquo; Imani said, blushing a bit.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I did, actually,&rdquo; Liberty joked. &ldquo;It was all just a big prank. I&rsquo;m going to let the real me come out now, and from here on it&rsquo;s just going to be nothing but awkward silences and weird bodily functions.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThey laughed. That was the sort of thing that Imani found so endearing. As a lawyer she always appreciated a good wit. As a human, she appreciated the vulnerability behind Liberty&rsquo;s jokes. She could sense the truth behind the words. She felt like each joke brought her further inside.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Some silence would probably be good for me,&rdquo; Imani said after a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I work way too hard.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You really could have fooled me,&rdquo; Liberty retorted. A broad, playful smile slowly spread across her face.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh what do you know,&rdquo; Imani quipped back, playfully smacking her friend&rsquo;s arm with the back of her hand. &ldquo;Just because you make me take extra long lunch breaks.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh yeah, I *made* you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You handcuffed me to that chair and told the waiter to chase me down if I tried to escape.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well I always know I can use pepper spray on you. It&rsquo;s super effective.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty was the only person in the whole world who could have joked about that. Liberty seemed like the only person in the whole world with whom Imani felt comfortable enough to just laugh. She didn&rsquo;t feel like she had to prove herself or fight for respect. She just felt like herself. It was so liberating to finally just be herself.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after Liberty and Imani sat through so many episodes of Orangutan-based television they could barely think straight, Imani finally decided she should leave.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, I better get going before I end up falling asleep on your couch,&rdquo; she said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I do have plenty of room on my bed,&rdquo; Liberty said without really thinking.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Where would you sleep?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, I mean . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, I, yeah . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Anyway . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe topic of relationships did come up from time to time. Once, after an incredible indian meal that Liberty had cooked for them both, Imani was flipping through her phone. Liberty was working on the dishes - she ordered Imani under no uncertain terms to put her butt on the couch and literally not do any work for once.\r\n\r\nLiberty enjoyed taking care of things, occasionally glancing over at Imani&rsquo;s relaxed face, and the warm contented glow of being full of delicious masala. When she found out that indian was one of Imani&rsquo;s favorite foods, she almost made her drop everything so she could cook her something right there. \r\n\r\nLiberty loved to cook. It was something that made her feel in control. The ingredients had to bend to her will, and everything that was supposed to happen always happened. She loved the meticulous planning and procedure of baking, and the lovely improvised ballet of cooking meals. She also loved the look on someone&rsquo;s face when they ate something she made, or the contented, happy pain of overindulging on her meals.\r\n\r\nAs someone who was quickly becoming one of her favorite people, Imani&rsquo;s beautiful excitement at taking her first bite bordered on perfection. She was quite proud of herself as she loaded the dishwasher.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ugh, I hate tinder sometimes,&rdquo; Imani said from the couch, scowling at her phone even through the indian food afterglow.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, me too,&rdquo; Liberty replied.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Like, you match with somebody, and only then do they actually read your profile.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And it turns out there&rsquo;s some stupid nitpick about you that they don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Right. Apparently a public defender has &lsquo;too much baggage&rsquo; for this person.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, hey,&rdquo; Liberty said, bringing Imani a glass of water. &ldquo;You dodged a bullet.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I have so little time to actually date, it would suck to waste one on somebody who would say that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Is it different for a black woman?&rdquo; Liberty asked, sitting opposite her friend on the couch. &ldquo;On Tinder, I mean.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Imani said, putting down her phone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been a white woman on Tinder.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fair point,&rdquo; Liberty said, taking a drink.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, she asked, &ldquo;Are black dudes just as stupid as white dudes?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThrough a smile, Imani said, &ldquo;maybe more so.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty got wistful. Thinking of men made her remember some of the important ones in her life.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My father was a good man,&rdquo; she said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Was?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty smiled sadly and nodded. &ldquo;Heart attack. When I was sixteen. I was devastated for a long time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. It&rsquo;s gotten a bit easier every year, but I&rsquo;ll always miss him.&rdquo; Liberty took a drink. &ldquo;What about yours?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My parents are both still around,&rdquo; Imani replied. &ldquo;To give me a hard time. You should have seen them when I got this haircut.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLiberty watched Imani run her hand through her hair - or at least what hair she had left. In the week prior she had gotten it cut, seemingly as short as was possible. She and Liberty had joked about what manner of industrial machinery was necessary to get through it. The tight curls still made it hard for the woman to run her hands through even at the shorter length.\r\n\r\nLiberty admired her friend, deeply, for making such a powerful change. Changing her hair was second nature for Liberty, who at this point had moved on to a bright pink color. However, the significance was completely different for someone like Imani, who had been carefully growing out her hair for decades.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;They were not happy?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, understatement,&rdquo; Imani replied, laughing. &ldquo;My mom cried. She *cried*!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, I mean,&rdquo; Liberty said, blushing slightly. &ldquo;Your hair was really gorgeous.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nImani blushed, too.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But I mean, I&rsquo;m so proud of you. For doing it. For doing something.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;At least I can do something,&rdquo; Imani laughed.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think you could do anything,&rdquo; Liberty said, staring at her glass.\r\n\r\n&ldquo; . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I mean, um . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, yeah, I know . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Anyway, um . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thanks for dinner . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThrough the months, they just fell into an easy rhythm together. They knew each other&rsquo;s schedule, the daily patterns of life. They could tell when one was having a bad day, and they celebrated happy moments. Liberty - Lib, as Imani called her - always knew how to make Imani laugh. Imani - Immie, to Liberty - could do the same.\r\n\r\nThey slowly got all of the mundanities of getting to know each other out of the way. This made way for the truly important things - sharing each other&rsquo;s passions. Liberty showed Imani some tricks in the kitchen, and Imani helped Liberty talk her way through a promotion at work. Imani took Liberty on hikes, and Liberty even tried jogging once. They found their favorite cafes together, watched their favorite movies together, and their platonic, almost sisterly bond grew.\r\n\r\nEach time they saw each other, they would share a quick, awkward hug, and each time one of them had to go they would suddenly remember they didn&rsquo;t know how to end conversations. Such was the nature of two socially inexperienced weirdos trying to relearn what they knew in kindergarten.\r\n\r\nEverything just made sense. Everything just worked. \r\n\r\nEventually they even got an apartment together. Liberty found a great deal, and needed a roommate. Imani&rsquo;s lease was just coming up, and she realized she would be saving money if she shared the rent with someone else. The first few weeks were a little strained, as they found a new way for their lives to mesh, but like everything else for them it just fell into place.\r\n\r\nThey never talked about it. They just wallowed in it. Every moment was an eternity.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThey were both sitting on Imani&rsquo;s couch, watching but not watching TV. Liberty was flipping through her phone, and Imani was checking some notes for work. She loved just having Liberty nearby, like it was proof she wasn&rsquo;t alone in the world. Before she met Liberty, a part of her was legitimately worried she would always be too busy to be anything but alone.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sick of being single,&rdquo; Liberty said absently. Imani smirked as once again Liberty seemed to read her mind.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;In court sometimes we ask jurors to look at the &lsquo;common denominator,&rsquo;&rdquo; Imani teased. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the common thread in your string of bad dates?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; Liberty said, with a sigh. &ldquo;Do you ever wish you were gay?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I . . . wait, what?&rdquo; Imani said back, looking up from her notes.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I just mean like what if, you know? It would be so much easier.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What would be easier,&rdquo; Imani asked, furrowing her brow.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, I just mean,&rdquo; Liberty stammered, she was blushing. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m not like coming on to you or anything.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, really, what are you saying?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really saying anything. It&rsquo;s just, you know, so hard to find lesbians.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo; Imani said slowly, her eyes wide as she stared at the floor. &ldquo;Are . . . are you gay?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah . . .&rdquo; Liberty said slowly. She sat up, as if suddenly six months awkwardness came rushing in.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What the fuck…&rdquo; Imani groaned, as her eyes slowly moved up to meet Liberty&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Lib . . . I&rsquo;m gay.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Liberty said, confused. &ldquo;I thought you knew. I mean - when we met - I had rainbow pins all over me.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Imani said, and they both started laughing.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other for at least a few years, mouths hanging open. In their time together they always know what to say, but not now, when it mattered most. Perhaps because it mattered so much, they didn&rsquo;t need to say anything.\r\n\r\nImani broke the silence first.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Have we been dating for six months?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; Liberty responded, understanding crashing over her like a wave.\r\n\r\nImani laughed, looking at her friend.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are we . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I mean . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We, yeah . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Lib . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Immie . . .&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTheir lips met, six months of passion and attraction that they hadn&rsquo;t even noticed suddenly rushing up to meet them like a wildfire. It spread, uncontrollably, and chaos took over. Netflix asked if anyone was still there. They weren&rsquo;t - they had gone somewhere special, the universe that exists only in their eyes as they looked at each other. The chaotic moment climaxed in a new chorus of screams.\r\n\r\nIn Imani&rsquo;s bed, they spent the night. Periodically they cycled between dozing off in blissful happiness, to drift wistfully through happy dreams, and waking to realize the dreams had come true. They found each and every way their bodies fit together.\r\n\r\nThe time passed like it always did with them, in an instant and an eternity. \r\n\r\nLater on, Liberty and Imani&rsquo;s kids (they took turns, eventually having four in total) got tired of hearing the story of how their moms met. The two women never tired of telling it, though.\r\n\r\nThe kids never realised just how lucky they were.',

That&rsquo;s it. Nobody wil lcare when u die.I hope you enjoy you&rsquo;re last moments alive on this earth. You did nothing worthwile with  your life. Good thing u dont have any kids because they would grow up to be feminist dykes and I am so sick of you feminiists.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>Posted by Death to Diana</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In one of the city&rsquo;s many coffee shops, a series of genuinely disturbing comments scrolled past a laptop screen. Diana Harbinger yawned as she read through them. It was nothing she hadn&rsquo;t seen a hundred times before. She tipped the last few drops of coffee from her cup onto her tongue, and sighed. When she first started writing for PopCultural, Diana found something strangely exciting about the wall of hate spewed anonymously at her after each new article. After a few years of it, though, it was starting to feel like a cliche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many people, someone saying that they are going to be posting pictures of their mutilated corpse on the internet in the morning would be cause for alarm. For Diana, it was Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s editor regularly called her to make sure she was okay, which was a gesture she appreciated but didn&rsquo;t need. He kept offering to ban some of the more vicious regulars, but he ultimately relented when she pointed out that the absurd drama was always good for ad sales. She found something exciting about the attention. She felt like she was doing something important by bringing these voices out into the light. She also really enjoyed making fun of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana always loved giving people the finger, and the more they deserved it the more satisfaction she got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few blocks away, at a small, ancient diner, Evelyn Bailey was also yawning. She patiently awaited the end of her shift. A Thursday afternoon was not exactly a peak time, so the place was very quiet and almost deserted. It was a greasy spoon diner, though, so a few folks could be expected as a matter of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the counter sat an old man whose name everybody knew (in fact, everyone thought they knew his name, but they all thought it was something different and they were all wrong). He never spoke, but he was always there. Everyone knew what he ordered because it was the same thing he always ordered, and at this point serving him became as regular as taking out the garbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chef - a large man with a name like Sal - was constantly occupied with the work of making it seem like the work of a greasy spoon cook was in fact the hardest job in the world. In some ways he wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but in much more realistic ways the overworked and underpaid waitresses who had to serve his greasy abominations had it much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He understood this, though, and so he did look out for his sisters in arms on the front lines of the quick service dining industry. They had the usual methods of recourse against those customers who made their lives difficult. Various innocuous-seeming code phrases on order tickets let the cook know what particular customers deserved. Known bad tippers had their signal, and handsy old men got theirs. Sal had little patience for disrespectful people in general, but he had even less patience for anyone who would make trouble for the people he had to work very long hours with. Revenge was a dish best served at the lukewarm temperature that everything served at a diner ends up being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around this time, Margaret Allen - fully awake this time - was trying to get her computer to cooperate. She was telling what she was supposed to tell it to get it to do what she wanted it to do. It just wasn&rsquo;t doing it. Her firm had upgraded their design software earlier in the month, and a few of her favorite shortcuts had changed. She sighed to herself. She had only just gotten used to the new shortcuts after the last update. Things that work shouldn&rsquo;t change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She flicked the little rocking desk toy she kept near her keyboard. Unlike her stupid computer, it always worked. It was a pair of little wire figures balanced on either end of an armature, like two very skinny people sharing a seesaw. When flicked, the perfectly balanced figures rocked back and forth for a surprisingly long time. It was rather satisfying to watch them go, and counting the rocks helped her clear her mind. The record so far was two hundred forty eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toy was positioned rather specifically, as was everything on her desk. It was a rather sacred space to her, as she made very clear to her coworkers. Once an intern at the firm needed some clear tape, and found Margaret&rsquo;s dispenser (two inches left of her left monitor stand, just behind her stack of post-its, tape pointing to the left). She returned it almost immediately, placing it between Margaret&rsquo;s post-its and her coffee mug. Several strongly-worded emails later, and it was determined that nobody in the office was to touch anything on her desk unless lives depended on it. She would have preferred dropping even that provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the general rules of literature that an author never names a character something like &ldquo;Dickweed.&rdquo; It skews the character, and it forces readers to form opinions about them before they get to do anything. It is especially egregious in a script. An actor loses a great deal of freedom when they get a character simply referred to as &ldquo;asshole.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with full awareness of this rule that the next character will only be referred to as Dickweed Barista, because that tells you everything you need to know about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s hands were hovering over her keyboard to write a response to the comment she had just read. Before she could get very far, the music she was listening to was cut out. She was suddenly snapped back to the world of one of the city&rsquo;s many coffee shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dickweed Barista stood over Diana with a sickeningly friendly smile, one of her earbuds pinched between his finger and thumb. She stared at him, trying to come to grips with the situation, and just how violent she should be in response. The wails of Bikini Kill could still be heard coming from the little nub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything, honey?&rdquo; He asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; She muttered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classic rock played innocuously as Evelyn looked up at the clock on the wall of the diner. The clock&rsquo;s hands were barely visible through glass that had been frosted by decades of grime. Evelyn generally tried to avoid looking at the clock, because beneath all those layers of old grease, those hands somehow moved slower than normal clocks. Surrounding the clock was scores of junk, exactly the sort of junk that seems to just grow naturally on the walls of old diners. The ceiling was stained from cigarette smoke, despite the fact that cigarettes had been banned inside the place for over a decade. The whole place used to be mostly white, but at this point it was getting hard to tell. The white had given way over the decades to the greys, browns, and beiges that always follow in the wake of human society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn spent more time in this grimy place than her own home, but it was her domain. She was the duchess of grease, and the diner was for all intents and purposes hers. Technically, her name wasn&rsquo;t on the door (that said &ldquo;Marcie&rsquo;s&rdquo;), her name wasn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s paycheck (except her own, of course), and she had little real authority. What she had was the authority of tenure, and the determination of someone who was far too tired to deal with any of bullshit. She knew how things worked, and made sure they continued to even though it wasn&rsquo;t what she was paid to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had collected the meager tips on her last table of the day when she heard a familiar voice. It was familiar in the way a chronic, stabbing pain is familiar. The trouble with being a longstanding waitress at a cheap restaurant (if you had to pick just one) was the occasional unbearable regular. This particular regular was called Eddie, and he had a thing for Evelyn. Evelyn had a thing for him, as well, but it was a very different thing with the words &ldquo;pepper spray&rdquo; printed on the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, can I get some help over here?&rdquo; Eddie asked. She rolled her eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heh, just kidding,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You can take your time. I&#039;m enjoying the view.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olympic athletes would be impressed by the tone and strength of Evelyn&rsquo;s eye-rolling muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margie,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s desk neighbor, making her lose count of the rocking toy on her desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. He was a very short man, which always seemed like it confused him. He seemed to always gesturing at his stature, as if to say &ldquo;surely this is all some sort of mistake.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Margaret,&rdquo; she said in a way that suggested she had said it a hundred times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come take a look at these plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scooted her meticulously adjusted office chair the few feet to his desk. Her desk toy continued rocking unmonitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble getting the clearance to work on this door,&rdquo; he said, pointing at some meaningful lines on his screen. He often needed her to do his work for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, see, you don&rsquo;t need a firewall there,&rdquo; she said, pointing at some different, but equally meaningful lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A firewall has to be self-supporting,&rdquo; she said, wondering if he even went to Architectural school. &ldquo;A fire barrier only has to go up to the roof deck. You&rsquo;ll have room for that other door there if you just use a barrier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he said, his brow furrowing obnoxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. The answer to the question, &lsquo;what if Napoleon were an architect, and also an idiot?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One time, Margaret got to work to find that <em>Greg</em> had moved everything on her desk an inch to the left. He did it as a prank. She didn&rsquo;t have to notice him stifling laughter to realize what had happened, mainly because she noticed her desk was off from the elevator. She tried getting back at him by changing all of his chair adjustments while he was in the bathroom. He didn&rsquo;t even notice. He just swung his stubby little legs that no longer reached the ground. It was infuriating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, Dee,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista, handing Diana her earbud and returning to tidying the table next to her. &ldquo;I was just wondering if you needed anything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Die.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My name. It&rsquo;s not Dee. It&rsquo;s Di.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dickweed responded with an unfortunate chuckle. &ldquo;I was just going by what was written on your cup.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked down at her cup, marked &lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; and sighed. She had been forced to explain to people how to pronounce her name her entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Die,&rsquo; you know, like what we&rsquo;re all going to do some day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are you concentrating on so hard, anyway?&rdquo; He responded, the not-so-subtle hints flying right over his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m working.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you write for Pop Cultural, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stared at him, knowing the large &lsquo;Pop Cultural&rsquo; sticker on her laptop was almost directly in his eye line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever gave you that idea?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything else, Mike?&rdquo; Evelyn asked the Man at the Bar as she refilled his coffee. She knew the answer, but it was still her job to ask and she took any chance she could to put off the same old conversation she had fake smiled her way through a hundred times before. She walked over to the booth Eddie had manspread himself into, and flipped to a new page in her order pad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, Eddie, what&#039;ll it be today?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What, no specials?&rdquo; He asked with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t talking about food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you really want the specials?&rdquo; She responded, with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I just like hearing you talk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you just want your usual?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, you know me too well, Eve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&#039;s Evelyn, and I kind of hope not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Haha, nah.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m just finishing my shift, but I&#039;ll get this in for you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, maybe I&#039;ll just get this to go and we can hang out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn finished jotting down Eddie&rsquo;s order, and suppressed a wince. What she needed was a big couch, a big beer, and a big distance between her and any thirsty boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I, uh, have plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was true. She always had standing plans specifically to be not hanging out with Eddie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Eddie replied, trying and failing to look nonchalant about it, &ldquo;maybe next time. I want to make sure you get a tip, though. You know I tip well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just put it on your receipt when you pay, like usual,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret&rsquo;s boss, one of the partners of the firm, walked by <em>Greg&rsquo;s</em> desk looking over some papers. He was much taller than <em>Greg</em>, a fact that often amused Margaret while her mind wandered during tedious team meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;make sure you get that environmental impact report on the Northbrook project to me before you leave today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. There was a different fabric print on the inside, as if they were designed to be rolled up to his elbows. One arm was rolled slightly higher than the other. All of this was deeply troubling to Margaret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, I was just about to send that to you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; <em>Greg</em> chimed in, leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;I was thinking about that - there are definitely some simple ways to avoid some headaches on the plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yup, I-&rdquo; Margaret attempted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&#039;s a good idea, Greg,&rdquo; said their boss. &ldquo;I think we&#039;ll want to make sure we get that into the report. Margie -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and send your findings to Greg so he can get that added in. Greg, you can get that to me next week some time. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. At least he didn&rsquo;t have to stoop very low to reach the butts he kissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great work,&rdquo; said their boss with a smile. &ldquo;Have a great weekend, guys.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret sighed. She had been working on that report for two weeks. She had researched code requirements and survey reports on the site itself, and reconciled them with the needs of the client. That was, in her estimation, her job as an Architect, so it barely needed mentioning. However, considering <em>Greg</em>probably didn&rsquo;t even know what survey reports even were, she always felt the bar was pretty low (bonus height joke).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You should smile more,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see you in here working all the time. You&#039;ll brighten my day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was enough for Diana. She slammed her laptop closed, and started collecting her things. A young woman out in public generally is going to get hit on, but she didn&rsquo;t have to like it. Diana had done as much as she could, covering herself in tattoos and piercings, occasionally even shaving her head, but still the idiots would come along with their suggestions for how she could be prettier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Listen, you&#039;re really not my type,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&#039;re probably into, like, artistic guys?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m not into guys at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh awesome,&rdquo; he said with a stupid grin. &ldquo;You&#039;re a lesbian? That&#039;s hot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ugh, you just lost your talking privileges.&rdquo; She said, visibly cringing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, I&#039;m just trying to be friendly, honey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#039;re doing a real shitty job, sport.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stormed out of the coffee shop, leaving Dickweed holding his hands out in confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret gave her desk toy a flick and started working on an email. At least she still knew the shortcuts to Outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\'quote\'>\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attached is the document I have been working on for the last few weeks.

          '<p><em>Much has been said about Witches. It would be foolish to think this was entirely by their design. It would also be rather foolish to assume this has been entirely to their benefit. However, the monumental position that Witches have in human culture is largely by their design, and it has largely been to their benefit. The stories you may have heard about witches throughout history, in that clever way that old stories often find a way of being, are entirely true. They are also, in that mundane, disappointing way that reality always imposes on things, entirely works of fiction.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The secret that every good Witch knows is this: Fiction and Reality are not mutually exclusive.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The fact remains that a Witch is in every way exactly what you would expect her to be, while at any moment capable of things you would never expect her to do.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith Araneus Midnight looked down at the spell she had constructed and took a deep breath. She grinned softly to herself. She rarely smiled, more rarely still in public, but she had the sort of smile that was clearly not a good sign. She had a smile that was most definitely at someone else&rsquo;s expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Lilith&rsquo;s smile, she was not born with her name. Her original name has been lost to history, or at least to the very definite impression that she will make suffer anyone who might try to sneak a glance at her passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like the Witch herself, names are fluid things. Lilith had decided at a young age that her name could be whatever she wanted it to be, and so she chose something that would suit the image she wanted to present for herself - Lilith Greene. A few years later, when she was at a slightly less young age, she decided she wasn&rsquo;t going to be a botanist and changed her name again. She eventually discovered her true passion - being generally terrifying - and so her image and name settled on their ultimate forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is here that any description might feel the need to resort to vapid, flowery language about Lilith&rsquo;s appearance. Though she did, as it happens, have on her person the various female body parts usually described with words like &ldquo;lithe&rdquo; and &ldquo;supple,&rdquo; it would be an insult to her to limit a description to that which she has in common with most other humans. She could, indeed, use her femininity to her advantage when she needed. However, when someone appears in a big, dark cloak, silhouetted against some lightning as they cackle maniacally into the night, onlookers don&rsquo;t usually concern themselves with how gracefully that person&rsquo;s hips will sway. Beauty is, of course, only skin deep. Power was always more important to her, and power coursed through her blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her spell that night had been well made - perhaps her best yet. The quality of work wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, of course. She had been practicing for quite a long time. Oneiromancy was a very difficult and subtle art. The trick was finding the right scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had started, many years ago, trying to manipulate world events as a whole. This proved fruitless, as working at that sort of scale would require much more power than even Lilith had. The trick, she realized, was thinking small. Act locally, think locally-er. It is easy to manipulate individuals, to gently guide them down a path that you chose for them. The flow of events is like a river. You can&rsquo;t just change what direction the river flows, but if you add a few strategically placed trees upstream, the flow will be ever-so-subtly affected. Over time the banks will begin to change. It would take time, but Lilith had plenty of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a tap on the window. A large black raven peered inside, his massive eye reflecting the crescent moon. It was Bodach, Lilith&rsquo;s familiar. At least, he was familiar to her. She called him her familiar in the same way that she called her sisters Agnes and Clarinda her &ldquo;colleagues.&rdquo; Bodach didn&rsquo;t speak to her - at least not in the way old fairy tales might suggest. He didn&rsquo;t transform or give her some mystical second sight. He wasn&rsquo;t magical at all. Bodey was simply Lilith&rsquo;s pet. Familiar just sounds so much more Witchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith had a deep fondness for ravens, as might be expected looking at her wardrobe. She appreciated the way their dark, mysterious quality supported her own. Bodach - this particular one, anyway - was the latest in a long line of birds all named Bodach lucky enough to win her favor. They were always ravens, they were always huge, and they were always male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She blew out a number of candles that were placed in a ceremonially important arrangement on the floor, and then strode to the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bodey,&rdquo; she said sweetly as she opened the window. If anyone knew she spoke to animals in such a gentle way she would quickly make sure they didn&rsquo;t know for long. &ldquo;What have you brought me this evening?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been nice if she could convince her familiars to bring her useful things. At the end of the day, however, they were always just ravens. Ravens have a habit of picking up random bits of falderal that they find interesting. Usually the things they find interesting are things that another person had thrown away. Often those things were in varying levels of decomposition. More than once it was a cigarette butt. Lilith added their less toxic offerings to a little altar, which over the years had become a massive piece of terrifyingly unwieldy folk art. Lilith liked to think it was full of the energy of those who hand handled the components through the years. An onlooker might assume it was full of disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodey tilted his head, a stretch of red ribbon dangling from his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly little boy,&rdquo; Lilith continued, taking the ribbon. &ldquo;You know your mistress so well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scratched his head, and he closed his eyes and nuzzled into her fingers affectionately. She tied the ribbon loosely around one of her necklaces, and it hung between her collarbones like an open wound. Perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith&rsquo;s wardrobe was almost entirely black. It was not quite entirely black simply because a few bright red accents always go a very long way in the symbolism department. Likewise, the grey streak in her hair seemed to serve simply as a sinister taunt, inviting any poor unfortunate passerby to question her age even for a moment. She was never seen without a number of rings and necklaces - every single one was worn for a very specific purpose, and almost all of them were adorned with images of death. She had the fashion sense of someone who cared very much about coming across like she didn&rsquo;t care at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak thoughtfully. His lithe, supple feet hopped onto the windowsill, and he eyed Lilith in a rather hungry sort of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Typical man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Always expecting something in return.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood up and retrieved a bowl she had been using in her spell. One convenient thing about having a Raven familiar is that they like to eat a number of the more perishable spell ingredients, so it added a bit of synergy to the whole operation. Oneiromancy had an unpleasant need for small rodent parts, but luckily Bodach considered them a delicacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other important task that Bodach performed for Lilith was as the proverbial whipping boy for her general opinions on the world. This was the main reason it was important for Bodach to be male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said, stroking his black feathers. &ldquo;Get fat and lazy and then leave.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bocachs through the years have had the important responsibility of bearing a great deal of avarice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood and began tidying up the space, putting - or throwing - the spell ingredients away as necessary. Bodach watched her, trained to enjoy the sound of her voice. To him her presence implied affection and the possibility of further treats. He had imprinted on her some sense of avian social obligation. If he had known the real meaning of the words she said to him, he might have felt differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps that is why her raven relationships always worked. She understood the machinations of avian social structures, perhaps better than she understood the human counterparts. She slung insulting aphorisms at him because he was an impartial, friendly ear. Her words didn&rsquo;t need to be understood. The important thing was that he never tried to argue with her. He always listened sweetly, intently, and then left her alone so he could find another piece of garbage to give her. In turn, she kept him warm, gave him whatever sense of purpose a raven requires, and filled him up with all the small rodent parts he could handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are very close, Bodey,&rdquo; she was saying, organizing the bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling around her. &ldquo;It might even be a matter of months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe my sisters are coming around. They aren&rsquo;t stupid men like you, so it has taken time to convince them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach shook his tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not long now, you fool. You useless little creature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach ruffled his beak under one of his wings. From the corner of his eye, he noticed some movement in a nearby tree outside. He spread his wings and gracefully lept from the windowsill. She let him go. He was her pet, but he didn&rsquo;t live with her. She had realized many Bodachs ago that though it was quite difficult to get a raven to be a pet - it was impossible to get one to be a house pet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So very soon,&rdquo; she said to herself now. &ldquo;Then your kind will be no more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She closed the window.</p>',
