      'I&rsquo;ve been wondering where the line is when it comes to gender representation. Is it appropriate for male creators to create female characters? Is it appropriate for male creators to express a point of view or a statement about life as a woman? Certainly under some circumstances the answer is yes. However, I believe there are circumstances where the answer is definitely not yes. I wonder if things can cross a line into something that we might consider "Gender Appropriation."\r\n\r\nAllow me to introduce you to a video game called *Bayonetta*.\r\n\r\nOkay, I know that video games in general are already extremely un-diverse, and the entire video game industry is fundamentally founded upon sexism. Describing a big budget video game in the context of feminism is very much starting off on the wrong foot. It&rsquo;s just that this is a really powerful example of something that concerns me.\r\n\r\n![Box art for the first Bayonetta game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/Bayonetta_box_artwork.png)\r\n> Here&rsquo;s the box art for the first game.\r\n\r\nIn the video game called *Bayonetta*, you play as the titular character called &ldquo;Bayonetta&rdquo; - a witch who did something or other to upset God and has to fight her way through hordes of angelic demons in a mostly brown world full of muddled symbolism and awkward cultural references. I think. The specifics aren&rsquo;t super important. Also the storytelling is almost completely incoherent. I&rsquo;m not an Anime Person, and I suspect *Bayonetta* is thick with anime tropes, so I&rsquo;m just going to chalk it up to my personal ignorance of the subject and not pass any judgements on something that isn&rsquo;t really My Thing. I&rsquo;ll let you read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta) for it if you want to know about the plot. I think I&rsquo;m pretty safe at least in calling it completely bizarre, as I believe that&rsquo;s the point.\r\n\r\nI also won&rsquo;t really discuss the gameplay, which is very much not My Thing either. It seems like it&rsquo;s pretty similar to games like *Devil May Cry* (which was made by the same company) or perhaps a similar genre to something like those new Batman games. You run around in a mostly linear level, and every room you enter gets locked until you beat up the assortment of enemies placed in it. Combat is purely based on mastering a series of complicated button combinations. Occasionally you find a giant monster boss and fight it in a very Cinematic^TM way which basically amounts to watching a video of cartoon characters punching each other while you wait for it to tell you to push a button at the right time.\r\n\r\nPlenty of people like the gameplay and I&rsquo;m sure they get something from the plot. Just because I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t make it invalid for those who do, so that&rsquo;s *fine*. I will say that I have played both games, though not to completion. The common response to feminist discussions of Bayonetta seem to be *[have you actually played it?](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/521788400538370048)* so I figured I should disclose that. Perhaps one cannot discuss the context, relevance, and message of a work unless they have experienced it in totality, but I think it&rsquo;s possible to have not seen every single moment of the game and still have thoughts about it.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to focus on is that titular main character, how she is portrayed, and the person or people who created her. Maybe I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; her either. Maybe she is totally *fine* too.\r\n\r\nSo just off the bat, here&rsquo;s what she looks like:\r\n\r\n![Bayonetta, the character, from *Bayonetta* the game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/Bayonetta-2-High.jpg)\r\n> This is an in-game screenshot. For the record, it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a picture of her that isn&rsquo;t of her butt.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll try to describe her as objectively as possible (feel free to add "for some reason" to the end of every sentence here). She is unnaturally tall and thin. She wears an all black skintight outfit with incredibly frilly sleeves and cutouts for her cleavage and her entire back. She wears eight inch stiletto heels which also happen to be guns, and a librarian&rsquo;s glasses which she has to constantly push up but which somehow never fall off despite the fact she is upside-down roughly 45% of the time. In addition to her shoes, she also carries a gun in each hand - all four have infinite bullets which do way less damage than when she kicks things.\r\n\r\nShe has superpowers that revolve around her hair, which her outfit is also made of. The stronger her attacks, the more of her hair is used, which means more of her outfit is removed. There is no in-game reason for this, but I think the out-of-game reason is pretty obvious.\r\n\r\n![A climax move in the first game.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/5aa8d53e09583666daec85e1_2018022814070000-39044917CFF4239A6A8855A4FBFD24A3.jpg)\r\n> Here she can be seen committing one of the game&rsquo;s finishing moves, called a &ldquo;climax.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe is intentionally hyper-sexualized, and the game makes no apologies for that. The camera sweeps over her butt at any opportunity. Every attack results in her posing luridly with her legs spread and her body on display for the player. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a cutscene in either game that doesn&rsquo;t have her winking suggestively at the camera. Her powerups and health pickups are in the form of lollipops, which she playfully sucks on with a confident swagger. \r\n\r\n![A very common sight in Bayonetta](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/bayonetta-1-2-wiiu-1.jpg)\r\n> Here she can be seen doing a pretty standard attack in the game.\r\n\r\nHer more powerful attacks result in her being completely stripped naked, looking straight at the camera in a pornographic pose, apparently breaking the third-wall in acknowledgement of exactly why she exists. *I know what you&rsquo;re here for,* she winks at you, *and I&rsquo;m more than happy to deliver with a flourish.* This isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;prudish&rdquo; Lara Croft - a comparison made by one reviewer when the first game came out.\r\n\r\n![Finally a female character who will show me what I, a 14 year old boy, want to see](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/460790_screenshots_20181010213434_1.jpg)\r\n>Presented without comment.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, apparently Lara is a prude for having the audacity to not strip naked for the player (despite the numerous rumors that 12 year old boys like to pass around about the Tomb Raider games).\r\n\r\nBayonetta makes jokes (at least, the way certain lines are written are clearly meant to be jokes, despite how funny you might actually find them). She makes fun of other characters. She&rsquo;s ridiculous, to an extreme. Perhaps she&rsquo;s just camp? A sort of satire on sexualized characters in general?\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with self-actualized hyper-sexualized characters. Sex exsits, humans are sexual beings, and women are entitled to express their sexuality as much as anybody else. I believe that there are folks who are empowered and inspired by Bayonetta&rsquo;s unapologetic sexuality. Also, as someone who has a fascination with witches, obviously the idea of a witch who shoots demons with her feet does pique my interest.\r\n\r\n![A totally normal sight.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/s3-7ea3a303bd62d9ba67565b803b1fb4d1.jpg)\r\n>I mean fair enough, she&rsquo;s not the only completely bizarre aspect of these games.\r\n\r\nBut here&rsquo;s the thing.\r\n\r\nWho is making her do these things? The character design *is* credited to a woman - Mari Shimazaki. She went through thousands of iterations with the game&rsquo;s creators to capture their vision, and she certainly expressed her own interpretation of femininity in the character. I don&rsquo;t want to discredit her creative contributions, but I&rsquo;m quite sure that a number of the character&rsquo;s design decisions were not hers. She was absolutely implementing *their* vision. Other than that one designer and the character&rsquo;s voice actress, everyone else involved with the game is male, including the director, writers, producers, modelers, animators, and designers. I dare say most of the players, as well. The pen which drew some concept art might have been held by a woman, but this character is a male creation.\r\n\r\n![Female empowerment?](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/s12-5d186bc0f68f45859c892bf0fd3387bc.jpg)\r\n>Is this female empowerment?\r\n\r\nThe series creator, Hideki Kamiya, referred to the final design for Bayonetta as his &ldquo;ideal woman.&rdquo; About giving her glasses, the designer admitted that it was &ldquo;possibly [Kamiya&rsquo;s] preference for women with glasses.&rdquo; If she was intended to be hyper-sexualized, she was clearly intended to be a man&rsquo;s fantasy-fulfillment, too.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot from Bayonetta 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/5aa8d5ff04a9ce99e4940f54_2018030221550500-E27E5ADA5A86332E7C52B3562FCF5A27.jpg)\r\n>She has a shorter haircut in the second game, which is clearly the element they meant to showcase in this screenshot.\r\n\r\nSo here&rsquo;s the real question - is this okay?\r\n\r\nObviously men should be able to create female characters, and perhaps even sexualize those characters. However, *Bayonetta* the game isn&rsquo;t just portraying a female character - it&rsquo;s making a statement. Whether intentionally or not, these games are normalizing the idea of a woman being overt with her sexuality. Is that an argument that a man should be able to make? __Women are totally allowed to be sexual, but are men entitled to be sexual on their behalf?__\r\n\r\nThe games are extremely highly regarded, for the record. They&rsquo;ve been referred to as masterpieces, with the character being propped up as one of the &ldquo;greatest of all time.&rdquo; As I said, it&rsquo;s not My Thing, but it&rsquo;s clearly a lot of Peoples&rsquo; Thing, and they are able, either willingly or ignorantly, to ignore or rationalize the questionable aspects of the game because they find it fun to play.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the &ldquo;greatest of all time&rdquo; - if we&rsquo;re talking about female characters, Bayonetta certainly isn&rsquo;t the first to be created by men. The fact is that most female characters - even the ones you might think of as totally unproblematic feminist figureheads - were probably created by men, too. Looking through the [List of female action heroes and villains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_action_heroes_and_villains) page on Wikipedia only comes up with a (Count Rugen) handful actually created by women - Anna and Elsa from *Frozen*, Merida from *Brave*, Trinity from the *Matrix* films, Katniss Everdeen, and Hermione Granger. Who made the rest? Men.\r\n\r\nTake Wonder Woman, for example. It&rsquo;s widely acknowledged that her creator, \t\r\nWilliam Moulton Marston, created her as an expression of his interest in bondage and general fetishization of powerful women. Wonder Woman, then, is just as much of a male fantasy fulfillment as Bayonetta. She was pretty heavily sexualized, too. Sure, she wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;gets naked when she attacks things&rdquo; sexualized. She was pretty riske for the 40&rsquo;s, though, and I know Linda Carter&rsquo;s outfit caused a bit of a stir in her Wonder Woman TV show in the 70&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s almost always written and/or drawn by men, largely because the comics industry - just like video games - is dominated by male writers and artists.\r\n\r\n![An actual panel from a Wonder Woman comic for kids.](https://storage.googleapis.com/denyconformity_assets/bayonetta/2017-02-15-07.43.10.png)\r\n> Cool cool.\r\n\r\nWonder Woman has (pretty much) always been at least on some level about the empowerment of women.  It\'s empowerment by male standards and male benchmarks, though. It\'s men saying, "this is what you should aspire to be," not women saying "this is I want to be." Maybe it fits both questions, for at least some people. One woman\'s ideal won\'t match another\'s, no matter who described it. Does the *Bayonetta* question apply to Wonder Woman? __Women are totally allowed to feel empowered, but are men entitled to empower women on their behalf?__ Is there a moral difference between men empowering women and sexualizing them, especially when the core goal of that representation is to entertain a largely male audience?\r\n\r\nAt what point is it no longer acceptable for a man to make a woman - even a fictional one - do something for his enjoyment?\r\n\r\nFor the record, I thought about including some links to &ldquo;additional reading&rdquo; on the subject of Bayonetta and female representation, but you can Google those things as easily as I can. If you&rsquo;re interested in this subject, I encourage you to. If you would like a copy of *Bayonetta 2* on the Switch so you can properly make comments about it on Twitter, I could send you mine.',
