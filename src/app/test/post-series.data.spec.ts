            '<p><em>It has been said that One only remembers One&rsquo;s dreams when One wakes up in the middle of them. Exactly who has said this and exactly who this proverbial One is remains unspecified. However, since this is being included as the opening paragraph of a Very Serious Story, it must be regarded as true. Those Ones who remember their dreams well are likely to be Ones for whom sleep is like an elusive fairy tale. Perhaps dreams, then, are a sort of evolutionary consolation prize for the partially insomniatic. Perhaps they have been burdened with this curse of wakefulness because their dreams are portents of a world that must not be forgotten.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One may never know.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret Allen wasn&rsquo;t worried much about her dreams. This was because she was more concerned with trying not to get soaked by the downpour she found herself in. Lightning split the sky as she pulled her raincoat tighter around her. She splashed through a puddle as she jogged down the dark alleyway. Puddles and dark alleys just naturally seem to go together, like lightning glinting off a mysterious yet obtrusively nondescript metallic door hiding in plain sight alongside them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret pounded on the door. She didn&rsquo;t need to say the password - they were expecting her. Passwords were really more of a formality, anyway. Everyone knew who was meant to be there. The door was pulled open with the rather evocative sound of a big rusty metal door scraping against concrete. Margaret squeezed inside, dripping on the wet floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She made her way to the back of the chamber. She left her raincoat on. Being a modern raincoat, it created a system of equilibrium where even though you ended up essentially just as soaking wet as if you had not been wearing it, you at least couldn&rsquo;t tell just how wet you were because it was being held in by some sort of space-age plastic material with &ldquo;tex&rdquo; or &ldquo;lon&rdquo; in the name. For another thing, in dark mysterious chambers full of sinister cabals it just felt more appropriate to be wearing something with a hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting had already begun. Margaret was growing increasingly aware that she wasn&rsquo;t sure how she got there, or for that matter why. The room was thick with cigar smoke and arrogance, which it could be said are synonymous. A large crowd of gathered men were crowding the room, as a large crowd is want to do. They were standing generally in subservience to an imposing, cloaked figure sitting on a raised platform at the head of the chamber. That figure quieted the room with a few beats of its gavel, and then it spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said: &ldquo;This commences the meeting of the commercial and political interests in the city. Is every man here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A man in the gathered crowd responded. He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also here,&rdquo; concurred another man standing nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m -&rdquo; another man began, but the leader interrupted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said.&rdquo; Obviously every man here is here. What about the men who are not here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he who is not here should let us know that he is not here,&rdquo; chimed in one of the helpful subordinates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; responded the leader again. &ldquo;Point of order - in future meetings any brothers who are not here should let the rest of us know that he is not here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That solves the issue for future meetings,&rdquo; responded one of the men, who looked like the sort of man who liked pointing out problems to everyone. &ldquo;What about tonight?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; said the leader, somewhat deflated. &ldquo;Well, brothers, look around you. Do you see any man missing tonight?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, good idea,&rdquo; said one of the obvious brownnosers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd all spent a few moments looking around at each other. There was much mumbling and grumbling of things throughout the chamber. A few hoods were thrown off as men learned how generally impractical hoods were in dark rooms. Margaret, for her part, made a show of checking her neighbors, though in her case it was more out of confusion than to make roll call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, a call to action rose through the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where is Brother Matthew?!&rdquo; exclaimed a member of the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Matthew isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He should have let us know!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Does any man know where Brother Matthew is?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; called out Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We thought you weren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; the Leader said over the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; clarified Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd resumed the grumbling and mumbling, muddling their way through this improvised attendance check. It&rsquo;s a seldom considered problem that maintaining a satisfactory evaluation of attendance has been the bane of secret cabals through the centuries. It&rsquo;s all well and good to have dreams of world domination, corporate takeovers, or fixing your local tee-ball league, but sinister schemes are often thwarted before they begin by the simple matter of understanding who is and is not onboard. It&rsquo;s not exactly like the members can just broadcast their attendance on Twitter. What&rsquo;s the point of being a secret society if everybody is going to know about it? On the other hand, every missing member unaccounted for could be off forming their own secret counter-cabal, to fix the tee-ball games against you. The conspiracies you fight for are often made or broken on keeping track of your co-conspirators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where is Brother Gregory?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new outcry snapped everyone out of their mumbly reverie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory isn&rsquo;t here either!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory,&rdquo; the Leader called, &ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A general murmured call for Brother Gregory spread through the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the Leader concluded. &ldquo;Let the record show that Brother Gregory is also not here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the chief brownnoser tentatively interceded. &ldquo;Who has the record?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory has the record!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He really should have notified us that he wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the chief brownnoser interceded again. &ldquo;Does any man know where Brother Gregory is?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory had a business trip this week, did he not?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General murmurs of agreement went up throughout the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There we are then,&rdquo; said the Leader, lifting his gavel in a conclusive sort of way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided. Brother Gregory is-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, wait, my mistake. That was Brother Michael.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the Leader, setting his gavel back down in a disappointed sort of way. &ldquo;Wait, Brother Michael isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much can be said about what happens when men gather in large groups. It is rather well established that, on the whole, the intelligence of man is inversely proportional to the number of men gathered with him. A gathering of men become decidedly less skilled in a number of areas than any given man on his own, particularly concerning willpower, logic, and attendance gathering. However, murmuring is one thing a group can do much better than any individual. It could be observed that any group of men is primarily just waiting for an excuse to strike up a good murmur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good murmur was struck in pursuit of Brother Michael.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He really should have let us know-&rdquo; began someone in the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He did let us know!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the Leader. &ldquo;But why did nobody notice that he isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; chimed in Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well speak up next time,&rdquo; the Leader chided, eagerly fetching his gavel up once again. &ldquo;Let the record show-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We don&#039;t have the record.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; the much deflated leader continued. &ldquo;You. Brother Stephen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I propose we appoint you-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is this a point of order?&rdquo; The chief brownnoser asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Leader replied, suddenly perking up. Points of order usually implied impending gavellings. &ldquo;Point of order! I propose we elect Brother Stephen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Seconded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We elect Brother Stephen &lsquo;Official Keeper of the Things We are to Add to the Record when We Find Brother Gregory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;All for say &#039;aye.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Leader continued, gavel hand positively trembling with anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group generally murmured an &ldquo;aye.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Opposed?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group generally murmured a &ldquo;nay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe the &#039;ayes&rsquo; have it,&rdquo; the Leader said, arm lifting his precious wooden hammer into the air triumphantly. &ldquo;Let the record show -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we find Brother Gregory.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let the Things We are to Add to the Record show.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Seconded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That we are to appoint Brother Stephen as the official Keeper of aforesaid Things we are to etcetera, etcetera.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gavel collided with the Leader&rsquo;s podium with a rather anticlimactic thud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now then, onto old business,&rdquo; the Leader continued. Suddenly, another man entered the chamber, a stack of pizza boxes held aloft. They were surprisingly dry, considering the downpour that Margaret braved earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, Brothers,&rdquo; the new man cheered. &ldquo;The pizza is here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the brownnoser added rather smugly. &ldquo;I remember where Brother Gregory went.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; another man added rather hungrily. &ldquo;I propose we eat pizza now before moving on to old business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd began to swarm Brother Gregory and the pizza. Interest in pizza is another trait that is increased in relation to the size of a group. Ready availability of high quantities of pizza can probably also be attributed to the general decline in the success of sinister cabals in modern history. This cabal, having managed to brave the storm that is accounting for missing members, was clearly unable to best the challenge of thinking clearly in the presence of a hot, fresh slice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret was more confused than ever. Deep down she understood that she was there for a Very Important Reason. Deep down she knew she was invited, knew she paid her dues, and took her vow of fealty. She also knew she took the bus downtown, found the specific alley she had never in her life been to before, and that it was raining despite it being actually a rather nice day. She just couldn&rsquo;t specifically remember any of these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the curious thing about dreams. Everything makes sense until you actually think about them. When she woke up in her room just moments later, she couldn&rsquo;t help but take a few moments to reflect on what had been a strangely vivid and realistic experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting at this point that Margaret was not yet a witch. It is mostly worth mentioning by way of teasing the fact that this story will eventually include things like witches. That is not to say that stories about frustrated young women aren&rsquo;t perfectly worthwhile on their own without having to include fantastical nonsense to keep your attention. It&rsquo;s just that it should be clear that witches will feature rather prominently later on, so you should begin preparing yourself for that now. You likely don&rsquo;t need to prepare yourself for a story about frustrated young women because if you aren&rsquo;t one yourself you will certainly encounter them every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she was not yet a witch, then, Margaret Allen didn&rsquo;t put much stock in the strange dream she had that night. She didn&rsquo;t take it, as she perhaps should have, as a harbinger of the unprecedented adventure she was on the cusp of tumbling out of control into. She had no way of knowing at the time that the secret cabal she had witnessed was a Real Thing, and the meeting she was observing had actually transpired exactly as she had seen it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She didn&rsquo;t know she had a prophetic vision. How could she?</p>',

            '<p><em>Much has been said about Witches. It would be foolish to think this was entirely by their design. It would also be rather foolish to assume this has been entirely to their benefit. However, the monumental position that Witches have in human culture is largely by their design, and it has largely been to their benefit. The stories you may have heard about witches throughout history, in that clever way that old stories often find a way of being, are entirely true. They are also, in that mundane, disappointing way that reality always imposes on things, entirely works of fiction.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The secret that every good Witch knows is this: Fiction and Reality are not mutually exclusive.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The fact remains that a Witch is in every way exactly what you would expect her to be, while at any moment capable of things you would never expect her to do.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith Araneus Midnight looked down at the spell she had constructed and took a deep breath. She grinned softly to herself. She rarely smiled, more rarely still in public, but she had the sort of smile that was clearly not a good sign. She had a smile that was most definitely at someone else&rsquo;s expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Lilith&rsquo;s smile, she was not born with her name. Her original name has been lost to history, or at least to the very definite impression that she will make suffer anyone who might try to sneak a glance at her passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like the Witch herself, names are fluid things. Lilith had decided at a young age that her name could be whatever she wanted it to be, and so she chose something that would suit the image she wanted to present for herself - Lilith Greene. A few years later, when she was at a slightly less young age, she decided she wasn&rsquo;t going to be a botanist and changed her name again. She eventually discovered her true passion - being generally terrifying - and so her image and name settled on their ultimate forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is here that any description might feel the need to resort to vapid, flowery language about Lilith&rsquo;s appearance. Though she did, as it happens, have on her person the various female body parts usually described with words like &ldquo;lithe&rdquo; and &ldquo;supple,&rdquo; it would be an insult to her to limit a description to that which she has in common with most other humans. She could, indeed, use her femininity to her advantage when she needed. However, when someone appears in a big, dark cloak, silhouetted against some lightning as they cackle maniacally into the night, onlookers don&rsquo;t usually concern themselves with how gracefully that person&rsquo;s hips will sway. Beauty is, of course, only skin deep. Power was always more important to her, and power coursed through her blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her spell that night had been well made - perhaps her best yet. The quality of work wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, of course. She had been practicing for quite a long time. Oneiromancy was a very difficult and subtle art. The trick was finding the right scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had started, many years ago, trying to manipulate world events as a whole. This proved fruitless, as working at that sort of scale would require much more power than even Lilith had. The trick, she realized, was thinking small. Act locally, think locally-er. It is easy to manipulate individuals, to gently guide them down a path that you chose for them. The flow of events is like a river. You can&rsquo;t just change what direction the river flows, but if you add a few strategically placed trees upstream, the flow will be ever-so-subtly affected. Over time the banks will begin to change. It would take time, but Lilith had plenty of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a tap on the window. A large black raven peered inside, his massive eye reflecting the crescent moon. It was Bodach, Lilith&rsquo;s familiar. At least, he was familiar to her. She called him her familiar in the same way that she called her sisters Agnes and Clarinda her &ldquo;colleagues.&rdquo; Bodach didn&rsquo;t speak to her - at least not in the way old fairy tales might suggest. He didn&rsquo;t transform or give her some mystical second sight. He wasn&rsquo;t magical at all. Bodey was simply Lilith&rsquo;s pet. Familiar just sounds so much more Witchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith had a deep fondness for ravens, as might be expected looking at her wardrobe. She appreciated the way their dark, mysterious quality supported her own. Bodach - this particular one, anyway - was the latest in a long line of birds all named Bodach lucky enough to win her favor. They were always ravens, they were always huge, and they were always male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She blew out a number of candles that were placed in a ceremonially important arrangement on the floor, and then strode to the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bodey,&rdquo; she said sweetly as she opened the window. If anyone knew she spoke to animals in such a gentle way she would quickly make sure they didn&rsquo;t know for long. &ldquo;What have you brought me this evening?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been nice if she could convince her familiars to bring her useful things. At the end of the day, however, they were always just ravens. Ravens have a habit of picking up random bits of falderal that they find interesting. Usually the things they find interesting are things that another person had thrown away. Often those things were in varying levels of decomposition. More than once it was a cigarette butt. Lilith added their less toxic offerings to a little altar, which over the years had become a massive piece of terrifyingly unwieldy folk art. Lilith liked to think it was full of the energy of those who hand handled the components through the years. An onlooker might assume it was full of disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodey tilted his head, a stretch of red ribbon dangling from his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly little boy,&rdquo; Lilith continued, taking the ribbon. &ldquo;You know your mistress so well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scratched his head, and he closed his eyes and nuzzled into her fingers affectionately. She tied the ribbon loosely around one of her necklaces, and it hung between her collarbones like an open wound. Perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith&rsquo;s wardrobe was almost entirely black. It was not quite entirely black simply because a few bright red accents always go a very long way in the symbolism department. Likewise, the grey streak in her hair seemed to serve simply as a sinister taunt, inviting any poor unfortunate passerby to question her age even for a moment. She was never seen without a number of rings and necklaces - every single one was worn for a very specific purpose, and almost all of them were adorned with images of death. She had the fashion sense of someone who cared very much about coming across like she didn&rsquo;t care at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak thoughtfully. His lithe, supple feet hopped onto the windowsill, and he eyed Lilith in a rather hungry sort of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Typical man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Always expecting something in return.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood up and retrieved a bowl she had been using in her spell. One convenient thing about having a Raven familiar is that they like to eat a number of the more perishable spell ingredients, so it added a bit of synergy to the whole operation. Oneiromancy had an unpleasant need for small rodent parts, but luckily Bodach considered them a delicacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other important task that Bodach performed for Lilith was as the proverbial whipping boy for her general opinions on the world. This was the main reason it was important for Bodach to be male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said, stroking his black feathers. &ldquo;Get fat and lazy and then leave.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bocachs through the years have had the important responsibility of bearing a great deal of avarice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood and began tidying up the space, putting - or throwing - the spell ingredients away as necessary. Bodach watched her, trained to enjoy the sound of her voice. To him her presence implied affection and the possibility of further treats. He had imprinted on her some sense of avian social obligation. If he had known the real meaning of the words she said to him, he might have felt differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps that is why her raven relationships always worked. She understood the machinations of avian social structures, perhaps better than she understood the human counterparts. She slung insulting aphorisms at him because he was an impartial, friendly ear. Her words didn&rsquo;t need to be understood. The important thing was that he never tried to argue with her. He always listened sweetly, intently, and then left her alone so he could find another piece of garbage to give her. In turn, she kept him warm, gave him whatever sense of purpose a raven requires, and filled him up with all the small rodent parts he could handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are very close, Bodey,&rdquo; she was saying, organizing the bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling around her. &ldquo;It might even be a matter of months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe my sisters are coming around. They aren&rsquo;t stupid men like you, so it has taken time to convince them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach shook his tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not long now, you fool. You useless little creature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach ruffled his beak under one of his wings. From the corner of his eye, he noticed some movement in a nearby tree outside. He spread his wings and gracefully lept from the windowsill. She let him go. He was her pet, but he didn&rsquo;t live with her. She had realized many Bodachs ago that though it was quite difficult to get a raven to be a pet - it was impossible to get one to be a house pet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So very soon,&rdquo; she said to herself now. &ldquo;Then your kind will be no more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She closed the window.</p>',

Diana Harbinger yawned as she read through them. It was nothing she hadn&rsquo;t seen a hundred times before. She tipped the last few drops of coffee from her cup onto her tongue, and sighed. When she first started writing for PopCultural, Diana found something strangely exciting about the wall of hate spewed anonymously at her after each new article. After a few years of it, though, it was starting to feel like a cliche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many people, someone saying that they are going to be posting pictures of their mutilated corpse on the internet in the morning would be cause for alarm. For Diana, it was Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s editor regularly called her to make sure she was okay, which was a gesture she appreciated but didn&rsquo;t need. He kept offering to ban some of the more vicious regulars, but he ultimately relented when she pointed out that the absurd drama was always good for ad sales. She found something exciting about the attention. She felt like she was doing something important by bringing these voices out into the light. She also really enjoyed making fun of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana always loved giving people the finger, and the more they deserved it the more satisfaction she got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few blocks away, at a small, ancient diner, Evelyn Bailey was also yawning. She patiently awaited the end of her shift. A Thursday afternoon was not exactly a peak time, so the place was very quiet and almost deserted. It was a greasy spoon diner, though, so a few folks could be expected as a matter of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the counter sat an old man whose name everybody knew (in fact, everyone thought they knew his name, but they all thought it was something different and they were all wrong). He never spoke, but he was always there. Everyone knew what he ordered because it was the same thing he always ordered, and at this point serving him became as regular as taking out the garbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chef - a large man with a name like Sal - was constantly occupied with the work of making it seem like the work of a greasy spoon cook was in fact the hardest job in the world. In some ways he wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but in much more realistic ways the overworked and underpaid waitresses who had to serve his greasy abominations had it much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He understood this, though, and so he did look out for his sisters in arms on the front lines of the quick service dining industry. They had the usual methods of recourse against those customers who made their lives difficult. Various innocuous-seeming code phrases on order tickets let the cook know what particular customers deserved. Known bad tippers had their signal, and handsy old men got theirs. Sal had little patience for disrespectful people in general, but he had even less patience for anyone who would make trouble for the people he had to work very long hours with. Revenge was a dish best served at the lukewarm temperature that everything served at a diner ends up being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around this time, Margaret Allen - fully awake this time - was trying to get her computer to cooperate. She was telling what she was supposed to tell it to get it to do what she wanted it to do. It just wasn&rsquo;t doing it. Her firm had upgraded their design software earlier in the month, and a few of her favorite shortcuts had changed. She sighed to herself. She had only just gotten used to the new shortcuts after the last update. Things that work shouldn&rsquo;t change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She flicked the little rocking desk toy she kept near her keyboard. Unlike her stupid computer, it always worked. It was a pair of little wire figures balanced on either end of an armature, like two very skinny people sharing a seesaw. When flicked, the perfectly balanced figures rocked back and forth for a surprisingly long time. It was rather satisfying to watch them go, and counting the rocks helped her clear her mind. The record so far was two hundred forty eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toy was positioned rather specifically, as was everything on her desk. It was a rather sacred space to her, as she made very clear to her coworkers. Once an intern at the firm needed some clear tape, and found Margaret&rsquo;s dispenser (two inches left of her left monitor stand, just behind her stack of post-its, tape pointing to the left). She returned it almost immediately, placing it between Margaret&rsquo;s post-its and her coffee mug. Several strongly-worded emails later, and it was determined that nobody in the office was to touch anything on her desk unless lives depended on it. She would have preferred dropping even that provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the general rules of literature that an author never names a character something like &ldquo;Dickweed.&rdquo; It skews the character, and it forces readers to form opinions about them before they get to do anything. It is especially egregious in a script. An actor loses a great deal of freedom when they get a character simply referred to as &ldquo;asshole.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with full awareness of this rule that the next character will only be referred to as Dickweed Barista, because that tells you everything you need to know about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s hands were hovering over her keyboard to write a response to the comment she had just read. Before she could get very far, the music she was listening to was cut out. She was suddenly snapped back to the world of one of the city&rsquo;s many coffee shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dickweed Barista stood over Diana with a sickeningly friendly smile, one of her earbuds pinched between his finger and thumb. She stared at him, trying to come to grips with the situation, and just how violent she should be in response. The wails of Bikini Kill could still be heard coming from the little nub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything, honey?&rdquo; He asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; She muttered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classic rock played innocuously as Evelyn looked up at the clock on the wall of the diner. The clock&rsquo;s hands were barely visible through glass that had been frosted by decades of grime. Evelyn generally tried to avoid looking at the clock, because beneath all those layers of old grease, those hands somehow moved slower than normal clocks. Surrounding the clock was scores of junk, exactly the sort of junk that seems to just grow naturally on the walls of old diners. The ceiling was stained from cigarette smoke, despite the fact that cigarettes had been banned inside the place for over a decade. The whole place used to be mostly white, but at this point it was getting hard to tell. The white had given way over the decades to the greys, browns, and beiges that always follow in the wake of human society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn spent more time in this grimy place than her own home, but it was her domain. She was the duchess of grease, and the diner was for all intents and purposes hers. Technically, her name wasn&rsquo;t on the door (that said &ldquo;Marcie&rsquo;s&rdquo;), her name wasn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s paycheck (except her own, of course), and she had little real authority. What she had was the authority of tenure, and the determination of someone who was far too tired to deal with any of bullshit. She knew how things worked, and made sure they continued to even though it wasn&rsquo;t what she was paid to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had collected the meager tips on her last table of the day when she heard a familiar voice. It was familiar in the way a chronic, stabbing pain is familiar. The trouble with being a longstanding waitress at a cheap restaurant (if you had to pick just one) was the occasional unbearable regular. This particular regular was called Eddie, and he had a thing for Evelyn. Evelyn had a thing for him, as well, but it was a very different thing with the words &ldquo;pepper spray&rdquo; printed on the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, can I get some help over here?&rdquo; Eddie asked. She rolled her eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heh, just kidding,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You can take your time. I&#039;m enjoying the view.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olympic athletes would be impressed by the tone and strength of Evelyn&rsquo;s eye-rolling muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margie,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s desk neighbor, making her lose count of the rocking toy on her desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. He was a very short man, which always seemed like it confused him. He seemed to always gesturing at his stature, as if to say &ldquo;surely this is all some sort of mistake.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Margaret,&rdquo; she said in a way that suggested she had said it a hundred times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come take a look at these plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scooted her meticulously adjusted office chair the few feet to his desk. Her desk toy continued rocking unmonitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble getting the clearance to work on this door,&rdquo; he said, pointing at some meaningful lines on his screen. He often needed her to do his work for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, see, you don&rsquo;t need a firewall there,&rdquo; she said, pointing at some different, but equally meaningful lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A firewall has to be self-supporting,&rdquo; she said, wondering if he even went to Architectural school. &ldquo;A fire barrier only has to go up to the roof deck. You&rsquo;ll have room for that other door there if you just use a barrier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he said, his brow furrowing obnoxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. The answer to the question, &lsquo;what if Napoleon were an architect, and also an idiot?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One time, Margaret got to work to find that <em>Greg</em> had moved everything on her desk an inch to the left. He did it as a prank. She didn&rsquo;t have to notice him stifling laughter to realize what had happened, mainly because she noticed her desk was off from the elevator. She tried getting back at him by changing all of his chair adjustments while he was in the bathroom. He didn&rsquo;t even notice. He just swung his stubby little legs that no longer reached the ground. It was infuriating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, Dee,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista, handing Diana her earbud and returning to tidying the table next to her. &ldquo;I was just wondering if you needed anything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Die.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My name. It&rsquo;s not Dee. It&rsquo;s Di.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dickweed responded with an unfortunate chuckle. &ldquo;I was just going by what was written on your cup.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked down at her cup, marked &lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; and sighed. She had been forced to explain to people how to pronounce her name her entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Die,&rsquo; you know, like what we&rsquo;re all going to do some day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are you concentrating on so hard, anyway?&rdquo; He responded, the not-so-subtle hints flying right over his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m working.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you write for Pop Cultural, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stared at him, knowing the large &lsquo;Pop Cultural&rsquo; sticker on her laptop was almost directly in his eye line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever gave you that idea?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything else, Mike?&rdquo; Evelyn asked the Man at the Bar as she refilled his coffee. She knew the answer, but it was still her job to ask and she took any chance she could to put off the same old conversation she had fake smiled her way through a hundred times before. She walked over to the booth Eddie had manspread himself into, and flipped to a new page in her order pad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, Eddie, what&#039;ll it be today?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What, no specials?&rdquo; He asked with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t talking about food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you really want the specials?&rdquo; She responded, with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I just like hearing you talk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you just want your usual?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, you know me too well, Eve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&#039;s Evelyn, and I kind of hope not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Haha, nah.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m just finishing my shift, but I&#039;ll get this in for you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, maybe I&#039;ll just get this to go and we can hang out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn finished jotting down Eddie&rsquo;s order, and suppressed a wince. What she needed was a big couch, a big beer, and a big distance between her and any thirsty boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I, uh, have plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was true. She always had standing plans specifically to be not hanging out with Eddie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Eddie replied, trying and failing to look nonchalant about it, &ldquo;maybe next time. I want to make sure you get a tip, though. You know I tip well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just put it on your receipt when you pay, like usual,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret&rsquo;s boss, one of the partners of the firm, walked by <em>Greg&rsquo;s</em> desk looking over some papers. He was much taller than <em>Greg</em>, a fact that often amused Margaret while her mind wandered during tedious team meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;make sure you get that environmental impact report on the Northbrook project to me before you leave today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. There was a different fabric print on the inside, as if they were designed to be rolled up to his elbows. One arm was rolled slightly higher than the other. All of this was deeply troubling to Margaret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, I was just about to send that to you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; <em>Greg</em> chimed in, leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;I was thinking about that - there are definitely some simple ways to avoid some headaches on the plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yup, I-&rdquo; Margaret attempted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&#039;s a good idea, Greg,&rdquo; said their boss. &ldquo;I think we&#039;ll want to make sure we get that into the report. Margie -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and send your findings to Greg so he can get that added in. Greg, you can get that to me next week some time. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. At least he didn&rsquo;t have to stoop very low to reach the butts he kissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great work,&rdquo; said their boss with a smile. &ldquo;Have a great weekend, guys.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret sighed. She had been working on that report for two weeks. She had researched code requirements and survey reports on the site itself, and reconciled them with the needs of the client. That was, in her estimation, her job as an Architect, so it barely needed mentioning. However, considering <em>Greg</em>probably didn&rsquo;t even know what survey reports even were, she always felt the bar was pretty low (bonus height joke).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You should smile more,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see you in here working all the time. You&#039;ll brighten my day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was enough for Diana. She slammed her laptop closed, and started collecting her things. A young woman out in public generally is going to get hit on, but she didn&rsquo;t have to like it. Diana had done as much as she could, covering herself in tattoos and piercings, occasionally even shaving her head, but still the idiots would come along with their suggestions for how she could be prettier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Listen, you&#039;re really not my type,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&#039;re probably into, like, artistic guys?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m not into guys at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh awesome,&rdquo; he said with a stupid grin. &ldquo;You&#039;re a lesbian? That&#039;s hot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ugh, you just lost your talking privileges.&rdquo; She said, visibly cringing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, I&#039;m just trying to be friendly, honey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#039;re doing a real shitty job, sport.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stormed out of the coffee shop, leaving Dickweed holding his hands out in confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret gave her desk toy a flick and started working on an email. At least she still knew the shortcuts to Outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\'quote\'>\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attached is the document I have been working on for the last few weeks.

            'Terry sighed softly to himself. He waited. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\nThe thing about Humans is they have a lot of problems. They tend to gather them, the way a large dog tromping noisily through a forest will gather burrs, funny little leaves, bugs, and small sticks. A Human would probably clear-cut that forest and build a shopping mall where it was, and then probably cite that as a reason they are superior to the average dog. The dog mostly just thinks about Ball, or Food, or Lady. At the end of the day, that shopping mall will just bring the human even more problems. The only problems the dog has are some burrs to wrestle out of its fur, which is actually kind of a fun game, and they&rsquo;re kind of like Ball a little bit when you think about it, and maybe there will be Food soon, and hey look at that funny little leaf.\r\n\r\nThe point is that problems tend to follow humans around. Most of the problems are their own doing, but in a cosmic sense, it&rsquo;s hard to really draw a line between problems caused by people, and problems caused *at* them. To the people with the problems, it hardly makes a difference. Problems are problems.\r\n\r\nFor Terry, this fact wasn&rsquo;t really top of mind. He didn&rsquo;t really understand the nature of human problems. Terry was a dog.\r\n\r\nHe didn&rsquo;t think too much about Ball anymore, and he was not likely to be seen doing much that would resemble tromping. This is because he was a very ancient dog, the sort that seems to resemble something more like a large, smelly rug than a housepet. Ball is a young dog&rsquo;s worry. Terry was a mutt, a mixture of breeds so diverse he looked like someone had thrown one of every dog into a big blender and then sculpted the resulting genetic masala into a greyish brown pile with some floppy ears and four massive mits. He spent most of his time flattened out, spreading slowly like a pile of fuzzy molasses, on different floors. He liked floors - they were always there for him when he needed them.\r\n\r\nOne night Terry was waiting, rug like, on the floor of a quaint but well stocked little kitchen in the center of a cozy home. He had slowly collected himself and grumbled his way to the kitchen in honor of his long standing duty to his Lady. It was an important job, watching over the things his Lady created in the oven. He did not understand why it must be done, but that was the sort of thing that dog does not question. All he knew was that it was his job to do.\r\n\r\nIn his hundreds of dog years, he never once got a chance to sample any of the rather delicious-smelling things that his Lady liked to keep in that funny warm box. Still, he dutifully stood (and as he got older, rugged) watch over the treats just in case after all this time she might finally remember his presence and deign to reward his diligence with a bite. He did not understand that pies, cakes, and pastries were not the sort of thing that dogs should eat. Sometimes Lady baked little bone-shaped things that became delightfully crunchy when they cooled, but that&rsquo;s different. He could smell it. He didn&rsquo;t understand the difference, but it was apparent. That was the sort of thing a dog does not question. He was there to serve his Lady.\r\n\r\nHis Lady was currently sitting nearby, with two other, lesser, Ladies. He knew she was better than them, because she was his, and so she didn&rsquo;t cease to exist quite as often as the others did. Also, she was the source of Food, and sometimes Cuddle. Terry was not too proud to admit his fondness for a good Cuddle.\r\n\r\nBut this isn&rsquo;t a story about a dog. This is a story about problems.\r\n\r\nThose three women sitting around the ancient dinner table always had a number of problems. They were humans - at least on paper - so of course their lives were a series of problems punctuated with an occasional sleep. However, the thing which set these women apart from other humans was that they were witches. Witches are problem solvers.\r\n\r\nThe sort of problems that witches usually solve are not always common, everyday problems.  Witch Problems are usually very much not the sort of problems Normal People face. Sometimes Witch Problems were not terribly different from the problems of the average dog, considering the amount of tromping around in forests the Craft often requires. Witch Problems are often mysterious. Witch Problems are often imaginary. This should not discount their importance, of course. It&rsquo;s complicated, being a Witch.\r\n\r\nTerry&rsquo;s lady was called Clarinda. Her colleagues were Agnes and Lilith. They were also known - depending on who you asked - as the Defenders of the Plane of Awareness, Guardians of the Staff of Death, or simply the Witches of Puget Sound and the Greater Vancouver area (when they make it up that way). They sat around a quaint, roomy table mulling over their latest problem. It was one of Purpose, and of Function. They were trying to understand their role in the latest iteration of this ever-changing world. It was, however, growing increasingly difficult to stay focused as the room filled with the aroma of pie.\r\n\r\nClarinda pushed herself up from her chair and walked to the kitchen with a great purpose. She had a sort of preternatural sense for when baked goods were ready. It grew from decades of experience in the grand tradition of the home baker. She had through her long life developed a sort of cosmic awareness of the nature of crust. The gluten spoke to her.\r\n\r\nShe stepped over the seemingly lifeless body of Terry, the ancient mutt who was her loyalest companion in the whole wide world. Like his mistress, he had also spent (dog) decades playing the important but underappreciated role of Baker&rsquo;s Companion. Through a great force of will and the expenditure of a frustrating amount of energy, he lifted his head from the floor, folds of skin and floppy ears following a moment later. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\nClarinda fetched her dog-shaped oven mitt, and retrieved the golden, steaming treat from the stovetop, where it had just achieved the perfect temperature for consumption. She smiled pleasantly to herself, admiring her work. The pie was topped with a lattice, woven into a rather artful and evocative shape with floral designs around the outside. The lattice gave peeks at the tart, gooey apple mixture inside. This was real magic - instantly irresistible, and plainly apparent. One could not behold this creation without immediately developing a pavlovian response. \r\n\r\nClarinda brought the pie to the table, placing it at the center to be beheld. Terry returned his head to the floor, his noble duty fulfilled once again.\r\n\r\nLilith rolled her eyes, as Clarinda had predicted she would, and Agnes burst into laughter. The lattice atop the pie was laid out in a rather unmistakably yonic shape.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So childish,&rdquo; Lilith said, a subtle smirk belying her amusement.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You say that like it&rsquo;s a bad thing.&rdquo; Asked Agnes, peering over the steaming perfection and licking her lips.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Getting mixed feelings?&rdquo; Asked Clarinda, turning the pie to face Lilith.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About one of your pies?&rdquo; Lilith responded. &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Agnes, hoping that by getting the plates ready she would be speeding the process of slicing and serving. &ldquo;There are so many phallic foods. It&rsquo;s about time we got some representation.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think pies should look like pies,&rdquo; Lilith said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I spent many years thinking that way - that everything should be perfect,&rdquo; Clarinda said, bringing a knife to the pie. The sharp blade stabbed right at the center of the confectionary vulva.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yikes,&rdquo; Agnes said, wincing. It was a rather visceral sight.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;&lsquo;Everything has its place,&rsquo; I thought,&rdquo; Clarinda continued, slicing the pie for each of them. &ldquo;There is a right way and a wrong way. Pies must look like pies, and so forth.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe expertly placed three perfect slices of yonic apple pie onto plates. Two sets of eyes were glued to them, and Clarinda knew it. Nothing focuses the minds of a group like a good pie. Clarinda was the oldest of the three, but by a largely trivial amount. Age is not an important metric for a witch. A few years of seniority begins to feel insignificant, when you realize you can tap into great cosmic forces and potentially live for thousands. Still, Clarinda played the part of the old, wise grandmother so well the others just generally went along with it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That is entirely based on a falsehood, though,&rdquo; Clarinda continued. &ldquo;I assumed that the universe operated on rules. That there is a rhyme or reason to anything. We all know that isn&rsquo;t true. The first thing we learn about the Craft is-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Lilith interrupted, waving her hand in as respectfully a way as one could possibly do. &ldquo;&lsquo;Reality is what we make of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well I choose to make vulva pie,&rdquo; Clarinda concluded, smiling sweetly. She had the sort of sweet smile that would make mortal enemies stop for a moment mid-combat and realize they haven&rsquo;t talked to their mothers in a while. While Lilith had spent decades practicing being terrifying, Clarinda was working on the opposite.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, for one, completely agree,&rdquo; said Agnes, looking at the other two somewhat annoyed. &ldquo;So can I have some pie while the two of you talk?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes could always diffuse the tension in the room. Her magical ability was always the weakest of the three, and she rarely took anything seriously. That was her real power, though. She was like a cat who could find comfort anywhere. Agnes had never met a situation she couldn&rsquo;t have fun with. She grew up in some manner of poverty in Estonia, and had to quickly learn how to adapt to uncomfortable situations.\r\n\r\nClarinda handed out the plates. Agnes tucked into hers immediately, with a satisfied moan. Clarinda held Lilith&rsquo;s plate before her, looking at her friend with her disarming smile.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Would you like a slice of my vulva, Lili?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask,&rdquo; replied Lilith.\r\n\r\nLilith often reflected to herself that she had the hardest job of their little triad. Agnes, as the youngest of them, never took anything seriously because she never needed to. Clarinda, the Mother, got to be the nice one. Anyone can be nice or silly, Lilith thought. It took real skill to be wicked. Not many Witches would readily volunteer to be the Crone and pull it off with such grace and (not that it needs to be called out) beauty. She raised the standard for the noble legacy of the Wicked Witch. She would never mention it, of course, but it would be nice for someone else to.\r\n\r\nLittle conversation happened while the pie was consumed. The calm silence was punctuated by forks clanking against plates, the groaning from the rug on the kitchen floor, and the occasional muttered Estonian expletive as Agnes enjoyed each mouthful more than the last.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lilith could not let the conversation go unfinished. She returned to the topic at hand.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So what do you propose we do, then?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Asked Clarinda.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Lilith responded incredulously. &ldquo;About us. About the world. About our futures. You two may not care about anything-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Woah, hey,&rdquo; Agnes interrupted, her brow furrowed. &ldquo;I care very much about anything.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But I,&rdquo; continued Lilith, undeterred, &ldquo;am very concerned about how we are going to continue to survive. We are in a world that seems to be less in need of our services by the day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So we find new services,&rdquo; Agnes chimed in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it before. Remember when the midwifery work got complicated? That&rsquo;s when we sold herbs and tinctures. Later, I started my Yoga practice. Then when people got bored with Yoga, I found Etsy.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Clarinda said, &ldquo;we always adapt. Times are always changing.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Have you noticed how even though things are always changing,&rdquo; Agnes said absently, licking the last few crumbs of pie from her plate, &ldquo;but everybody always thinks this is the Big One?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Take any moment in human history. I bet you everybody living there thinks that the world is totally turning on its head and everything good about life is disappearing. No matter when you look, their &lsquo;now&rsquo; is new and scary, and their &lsquo;then&rsquo; was when things really worked. I bet even the first Humans - you know, those strange mutated apes? They probably pissed off their parents by daring to walk upright and dream of wearing pants. They probably had the same thoughts. They probably talked about how great it was when their brains were smaller and they had hairier knuckles. &lsquo;Kids these days don&rsquo;t realize what living in a cave is really all about.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith was unswayed.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nothing is forever,&rdquo; Lilith said. &ldquo;Not even us.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Clarinda. &ldquo;But why should we fret about inevitabilities?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Agnes again. She felt strange having to always be the realist in a conversation with two Witches. &ldquo;Are we or are we not responsible for defending this plane of existence from hordes of evil who would try to destroy it?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; confirmed Clarinda. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So as long as said evil hordes continue existing,&rdquo; Agnes continued. &ldquo;Is there not a reason for us to still be around? This world still needs us, right? Just like throughout history, the world needs Witches.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Lilith, &ldquo;but this world has an important distinction from the world of our Foremothers.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have to pay bills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes had to concede that one.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The rent in my shop is going up again this year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The trouble with being secret defenders of existential planes is the lack of recognition. I mean sheesh, you&rsquo;d think we could at least get a key to the city or something.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Times change,&rdquo; said Lilith. &ldquo;So I say we should change, too. Not just adapting to the world around us, but actually stepping up to take matters into our own hands.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe other two stopped for a moment to consider this.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; Agnes argued, &ldquo;we can start selling potions and stuff online. There&rsquo;s tons of this stuff out there. People are forking over big bushels of money for stuff that doesn&rsquo;t even work. Imagine if it did!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Clarinda said gently. &ldquo;People won&rsquo;t be able to accept that. Magic doesn&rsquo;t work over mail-order.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t email a spell,&rdquo; Lilith said. She had tried.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sisters,&rdquo; Lilith continued, shrugging off Agnes&rsquo; idea. &ldquo;There is a storm coming. Can you not feel it? The winds of change are blowing harder than ever.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith had a way of bringing the lights down in a room. Agnes always thought that was neat, and leaned on her elbows, watching Lilith&rsquo;s intensity with a grin. Clarinda leaned back in her chair, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have weathered storms before,&rdquo; she said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But we will not forever. A storm will come that will break even the Great Clarinda.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what can I do in the face of such inevitability?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Break the storm.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ooh,&rdquo; said Agnes, fanning her face with her hand. &ldquo;Chills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Clarinda, what happens when we canot do this anymore?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We stop, of course.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But then what happens to the world?&rdquo; Agnes asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It cannot be left unguarded,&rdquo; Clarinda conceded.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Lilith, her eyebrows raising passionately. &ldquo;Consider, sisters, that this world is growing less and less isolated. It is no longer serving us to stay isolated ourselves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; Agnes retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault you don&rsquo;t understand how the Internet works.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you really suggesting that we go public?&rdquo; Clarinda asked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course not, we all know that isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; Lilith responded.\r\n\r\nThe forces that one might call &lsquo;Magic&rsquo; are complicated things. Witches don&rsquo;t presume to understand them any better than anyone else. In fact, if anything, Witches understand it even less. A Witch truly understands that they know even less than someone who doesn&rsquo;t even know how little they know. If you think that was confusing, that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Magic is full of weird stuff like that. It&rsquo;s no wonder all of the devotees end up so eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor example, every Witch knows that the Craft cannot be conferred to another. A Witch can&rsquo;t just go up to some young lady and ask, &lsquo;hey, do you want to learn how to really creep out boys and make weird teas?&rsquo; No matter how much they might be onboard, their mind just won&rsquo;t be open to it. Nothing will stick. A prospective Witch has to open the door herself. Nobody else can do it for you. It&rsquo;s like the opposite of tickling.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But we can get help,&rdquo; Lilith continued. &ldquo;We need not be three forever.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Clarinda said simply.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now, look,&rdquo; Agnes said sharply, fully prepared to mediate the argument. &ldquo;Wait, what? You agree?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes wasn&rsquo;t used to her two sisters agreeing on much.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Clarinda. &ldquo;I do believe it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How are we going to find new recruits?&rdquo; Asked Agnes. &ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s this web site called The Face Book, and-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ugh, we know about Facebook,&rdquo; said Lilith.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And I believe everyone has already moved on,&rdquo; Clarinda chimed in.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Right. I knew that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our replacements will find their way to us,&rdquo; Lilith continued. &ldquo;We all know that. That is how It works. We can&rsquo;t seek them out. The Universe must continue as it wills.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; Clarinda said, looking thoughtfully at nothing in particular, &ldquo;the Powers of the Universe don&rsquo;t agree with us, though. Don&rsquo;t you think They will ensure that events transpire the way the Universe requires, *when* the Universe requires?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I think They expect us to look out for ourselves,&rdquo; Lilith rebuked. &ldquo;If They had that much control, They wouldn&rsquo;t need us.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe thing about Humans is they like to think they&rsquo;re the top of the food chain. The more thoughtful folks, like Witches, knew this logically didn&rsquo;t make sense. There are forces that are higher than Humans - there have to be. Just like a Dog cannot comprehend the inner workings of his Lady, a Human can&rsquo;t begin to fathom the motivations of Time, or Death. It only makes sense that there are powers beyond human comprehension entirely. God? Perhaps, though most witches prefer picturing a rather more diverse pantheon. When you&rsquo;re just making stuff up, a witch might say, it seems pretty unimaginative to think there&rsquo;s just some white man up there all by Himself. Who would be cleaning up after Him?\r\n\r\nSo a witch might occasionally make comments about a mysterious &ldquo;They,&rdquo; questioning Their real power. If They really X, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean Y? It was more of a challenge than a question. It&rsquo;s a grasping at straws. Maybe if you say something that strikes a nerve, They&rsquo;ll finally do something about it. Then you&rsquo;ll at least have something to go on.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is the quick pause of silence that often follows an open challenge of a God&rsquo;s power, as the mere mortals waited for the confirmation or denial of that challenge. Maybe this time . . .\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Agnes said, cutting the existential tension. &ldquo;Faith would be so much easier if Gods would just tell us whether they exist or not.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So in the absence of context,&rdquo; Clarinda said, resignedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to make decisions based on nothing but the context we have.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLilith just sat back and let the snowball she had started continue its trajectory down the hill.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Okay, so we can&rsquo;t recruit,&rdquo; Agnes said. &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t we, perhaps, put out some breadcrumbs?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; Clarinda continued, staring at the remaining three quarters of her pie, &ldquo;we found someone. Perhaps a few someones. Suppose we planted seeds in their path; gave them knowledge they would need to open the door themselves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAgnes thought for a moment, and gave her sisters a sly look.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But wherever will we find women who want to have more power in their lives?&rdquo;',
