        'I think you answered your questions eloquently. The woman who drew Bayonetta did so not to show empowerment, but to give the (male) consumer what he wants. Empowerment can never be given, it must be taken. Women’s bodies have always been sexualized by men. So many times in my life I’ve been told to smile (by men). I’ve been complemented on clothes or shoes or my long hair (by men) as a type of reward for dressing to their ideal. When my hair is in a messy bun and I’m wearing sweats and a paint stained shirt or (heaven forbid) no bra, men are silent.  Think of that completely naked female protester in Portland, Oregon. She got between a line of police and the protesters wearing nothing but a beanie and a mask, and sat on the pavement with her legs akimbo. The police’s reaction was to back the hell up. One woman, empowering herself, not to please men, but to challenge them.  That is the difference between the protester and a stripper or character like Bayonetta, which are for men. I think intent means a lot here.'

        'This isn\'t female empowerment. This is objectification. I\'ve never played this game and am not much of a gamer myself. Before I even read the post I had a negative reaction to ber costume. Who can fight demons when they\'re costume is cut down to their butt crack? Sexual empowerment, to me, is when you feel good about using your sexuality. Here, she doesn\'t have a choice but to use it. If her literal weapons involve her hair and getting naked, she is not at will to refuse to use them if she\'s in danger. That\'s not power at all. That\'s having your power sexualized by others. It\'s maddening. Can you even win without using your shoe guns or hair or getting naked?'
