      "text": "<p>Well, this <b>past</b> weekend was the annual <b>Feast of the Hunter&#039;s Moon</b> festival at <b>Fort Ouiatenon</b>, West Lafayette.  The Feast is an <b>annual</b> event that recreates a 18th century French-Indian trading post that was in this area.  Many many people (something like 45,000 this year) come to the festival from all over the country to see <b>interesting things</b> and sample <b>interesting foods</b>.  Many of the people come dressed up in period clothing, dressed as 18th century traders and voyageurs <b>(<a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=voyageurs'>look it up</a>)</b>.  Since I was here at Purdue (just down the <b>Tippecanoe river</b> from Fort Ouiatenon), I went to the Feast with my <b>family</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I have gone to the Feast for <b>several years now</b>, and <b>the same sort of thing always seems to happen to me</b>.  Once I get over the initial shock of seeing so many <b>weird people</b> wearing weird things all at once, and I stop trying to look <b>cool</b>, I begin to see just how little there is to do.  The whole event is spread out over an area about the size of <b>two football fields</b>, and most of it is devoted to campers who go to stay the entire weekend.  About <b>half way through</b> the thing, however, I realize that it&#039;s not about <b>doing stuff</b> and <b>seeing stuff</b>, but it is actually just about simply <b>being</b>.  It&#039;s just about being part of the <b>whole experience</b>.  I don&#039;t care where I go or what I do, because I feel like part of a <b>community</b>, like I grew up and live with all of the <b>weird people everywhere</b>.  Eventually I can ignore all of the <b>stroller pushing suburban families</b> who do nothing but complain and get in the way (their children all have <b>fake</b> wooden swords and rifles).</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Everywhere you go the whole weekend, there may not be anything to do, but something is <b>happening</b>.  People are <b>singing</b>, or cooking something, or doing some sort of <b>presentation</b>.  We heard a great song about the various <b>amputational sacrifices</b> that one must make to become a pirate.  We had delicious handmade <b>apple dumplings</b>.  We saw some <b>Irriquois</b> presenting an example of their <b>native dance</b>.  It was a chance to escape the homework and <b>ego bashing</b> that is College, and go to a different time and place.  At least for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I had a great time with my parents, too.</p>",

      "title": "Games, Delayed",
      "text": "<p>I just got word that Half Life 2, possibly the most advanced game ever, is finally finished, and will be coming out on November 1st. I am extermely excited about it, but I am also a little worried. The game was originally scheduled for release on September 30th, 2003. That&#039;s a long time to wait for a game, not knowing just when it will come out. The real problem is that this is not a rare case. Most games are delayed, and most of those are delayed by an incredible ammount. Duke Nukem Forever, the proposed next game in the Duke Nukem series (extremely intellectual games), was supposed to be released some time in 1997. <i>DNF</i> is still <b>not out yet</b>, and the developers have <b>no idea when it will be released</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Other games, like <i>Daikatana</i> had similar fates.  However, when they finally did come out, they were horrible games, destroyed by the hype that came up because of the delay.  Whenever a huge game is delayed, the game is surrounded with so much hype that it could not possibly live up to expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I have two comments to give about this.  First is what will happen to <i>Half Life 2</i>?  I have no question about it&#039;s success (it is the sequel to the game that most people consider to be the greatest game of all time, and it looks simply breathtaking, so there is no question that it will sell), but will it be a good game?  I have preordered my copy already, and I have watched the <a href='http://www.e3expo.com' target='body'>E3</a> videos on a regular basis.  Am I getting too pumped for this game?  Movies can have the same effect happen, too.  Just look at <i><b>Star Wars: Episode 1</b></i> (hey, I loved it, but a lot of people didn&#039;t).  Am I destined to be dissapointed by <i>Half Life</i>?  Only time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>My other comment is this: how can <a href='http://www.valvesoftware.com/square.htm' target='body'>they</a> justify a delay of this magnitude?  When was the last time the creators of a movie decided to delay the release an entire year, just a week before it is scheduled to be released?  You don&#039;t see commercials on Fox for a new show, only to learn that it won&#039;t be on till the season after next (well, maybe that was a bad example).  Should the game industry be allowed to hold the <b>carrot in front of our noses</b> for so long?  For the most part, the games themselves are really the only things that get hurt, so one would think that developers would care enough to wait a little while before announcing a game.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Maybe I am jumping the gun a little bit.  <i>PC Gamer</i> has reviewed <i>Half Life 2</i>, and gave the game the highest score to date: <b>98%</b>.  Perhaps it&#039;s not that bad after all, hype or no hype.</p>",

      "text": "<p>The guys next door to me have a mock <i>Time Magazine</i> cover on there door that has a picture of George Bush, and the phrase <b>'We&#039;re F**ked'</b> underneath it (with the asteriks).  That about sums up my opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<p>I <b title='Actually I threw my vote away.'>voted</b> in my first presidential election two days ago, and I must say that it one of the <b>funniest ordeals</b> in my life (and not in the good way).  I will express my disgust and rage at the government here, where <b title='Well, anyone who comes to my site, that is.'>all</b> can enjoy and be enraged by it.  I will go ahead and throw my oppinions and frustrations into the fray with the <a href='http://www.bushin30seconds.org' title='Liberal Propoganda, or mostly truth?' class='black'><b>hundreds</b> of other web complaints out there</a>.  Bush must not surf the internet much.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I will try to stay away from just saying what everyone else has been saying for four years now.  All that stuff about Bush lying, cheating, and stealing his way through the United States.  Oh, well I guess I did say it.  That&#039;s not my point, though.  I have a series of ideas (read: crazy schemes) that I think would make this country a better place to live in.  But first, I will tell my story.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I woke up on Tuesday refreshed and ready for a day&#039;s hard work, coding my next web project (read: computer games).  I sat down in my desk chair, and remembered that it was Election Day.  Whoopie!!  For the first time in my life, I finally had a voice.  I could finally express what I felt for all these years with a simple hanging chad.  I hurredly got on my bicycle and rode off to Cary (Ironic? perhaps) Quadrangle, the local (read: only) polling place on the Purdue Campus.  I left in such a hurry that I forgot to take my registration card, or a book to read (you&#039;ll see why that was a problem later in my epic story).</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So I get to Cary (I still think that&#039;s a little weird), and follow the My Man Mitch signs to the small door that leads to the small room in the basement where an entire college campus was to vote.  You may be starting to see my problem.  I <b title='With full Cramming Power!!!'>crammed</b> myself inside, squeazing past the pseudo-line to get shelter from the drizzling rain that had gotten my bike seat all wet during the night.  I figured that it wouldn&#039;t be too long, judging from past election days and the primaries that I have witnessed.  I figured that voting was a smooth, quick process that only takes a few moments per person, so although the line was long, it would move fast.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I heard rumors up and down the line of the 15 minute wait.  The 30 minute wait.  THE 45 MINUTE WAIT.  And, with a hushed voice, the horrible, legendary monster: <b>the hour long wait!!!!</b> <i>**gasp**</i></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><i title='with maybe a few other cuss words in there, too. . .'>Damn,</i> I thought, <i>I should have brought my book to read in line.  Oh, well, I can just strike up a conversation with this really attractive</i> (read: hot) <i>girl in front of me.</i>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I didn&#039;t strike up a conversation with the hot girl in front of me.  She was studying, and I - um - didn&#039;t want to  - uh - <i>bother</i> her.  Yeah, that&#039;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Anyway,  that hour long wait would have been nice.  We waited and waited, the hot girl and I, and it seemed like my whole adult life was going to be spent standing in line.  It didn&#039;t really seem that bad (I went to the Star Wars Celebration 2, where I actually did spend most of the time in line).  It was annoying, however, because I just wanted to throw my vote away and get out of there.</P>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As we got closer to the little doorway of hope, we could see that people were spending up to ten minutes voting.  'What, did they add an essay question this year? What&#039;s taking so long?' I said in the best smart-ass college student attitude I could muster.  The students around me, who are used to essay tests, all laughed.  We started chatting.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As it turns out, the <b>board of elections</b> only sent <i>three</i> voting booths to Purdue University.  Three booths were to support an entire campus of hyped up, hip, voting college students.  What were they thinking?  The guy in charge said that they <b>didn&#039;t expect many voters</b>, with the small turn out at the primaries.  Okay, am I the only one who finds that stupid?  First of all, the primaries are really worth nothing, at least this year.  Secondly, didn&#039;t he see Purdue&#039;s own newspaper, which has reported record numbers of registered students this year?  How could anyone in their right mind possibly think that three booths are enough for a giant campus of unruly students?</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>My only consolation is that they gave us <b>stickers</b> when we voted.  Yes, that makes it all worth it: a sticker that says <b>'I voted.'</b>  <i>Joy</i>.  The guy behind me was annoyed because he got a <b>pin</b> four years ago.  'They must have spent all of their money on voting booths' I said with a chuckle.  Everyone laughed again.  I wish someone important heard that.  Or the hot girl.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So after two of those monsterous hour long waits, I finally got to vote.  I was a little worried that without my registration card I wouldn&#039;t be able to vote, and all that wasted time would be - well - wasted.  Actally it was not a problem.  All I needed was my <b>expired learner&#039;s permit</b> (yep), and I was able to fully waste my vote by writing in 'RALPH NADER.'  Indiana has voted Republican since God knows when, so it wouldn&#039;t matter just who I voted for.  A vote for NADER is a vote for BUSH as far as Indiana is concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I didn&#039;t even get to vote for the gay marriage issue.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So, yeah.  The United States voting system has some serious problems.  I heard that later in the day students were waiting upwards of <i>five hours</i> to vote.  CNN had already colored Indiana in with red before some of my friends were even able to cast their vote.  That&#039;s just not right.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So just to make my opinion <i>really</i> heard, I am going to list my ideas for how to make the US electoral system better.  Here they are, in no paticular order:</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>No person&#039;s vote should go uncounted.</b>  Why should we continue to work with a system that was invented for a nation of ignorant illiterates.  I don&#039;t want some 'electoral college' voting for me.  I want my vote counted.  The popular vote means absolutely nothing when you get right down to it.  Somebody has to agree with me on that one.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>More voting booths</b>  Wouldn&#039;t too many voting booths be better than too few?  <i>Honestly</i>.  I would even forgoe my sticker, if it means that I don&#039;t have to wait for two hours.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>We need another party</b>  Simple as that.  We need another party.  I am sick of the Republocrats running everything.  Somebody needs to step up.  Libertarians?  Greens?  Hell, even the Communist party would be a refreshing change of pace.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>The parties that exhist need better candidates</b>  Well, that&#039;s probably not going to happen, but I think that the Democrats could have done better than Kerry.  The Republicans could probably have done better than Bush, too.  When your candidate can&#039;t even explain his point clearly, you have a problem.  When your candidate can&#039;t even express a thought clearly, you have a problem also.  Try somebody else.  Al Sharpton?  I wish.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>Have more faith in the system</b>  At the very least, have faith in the system.  My problem is that I was told that they didn&#039;t expect many voters, so they didn&#039;t plan for a large croud.  'We didn&#039;t think that we would have many voters.'  Not with that attitude, you won&#039;t!</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>A new voting system</b>  When <i>America&#039;s Idol</i> gets ten times more voters than the Presidential election, that&#039;s a problem.  I know, I know.  <i>America&#039;s Idol</i> is very different than the Presidential election, but we could still learn from it.  How about a show where all of the presidential candidates (all of them.  Dean, Kerry, Al Sharpton, Bush, Nader, everyone) live together in a house, and every week the American people vote one off until only one remains?  I would tune in to see that.  It could be on Fox!  Imagine the possibilities!  It would be better than 'Amish in the City' at least.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><b>No multible terms</b>  How can Bush be allowed to spend half of his term campaining for the next one?  If Presidents are allowed only one term at a time, they would get a lot more work done, and be much more willing to give a crap.  Maybe.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<p>All I know is that the Government ows me <b>2 hours</b>.  I don&#039;t know how I want them paid back to me yet, but I will think of something.  Also, that internship that I was pondering at Relic entertainment (in Canada) is look more inviting every day. Both people I have told that to asked me the same smart-assed question:  'So you don&#039;t care about the high taxes?'  No.  I don&#039;t, thank you.  If if means that I can go about my life without <b title='It exists.  Face it'>Big Brother</b> looking over my shoulder, then no I don&#039;t mind the taxes.  Jesus.  Whatever.  I am not going to go on about the mess that this country is in (that&#039;s what the other web complaints are for), just the electoral system.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<p>There are probably more things to add to that list, but my rant is getting really long as it is, and I have homework to do.  I would love to hear some feedback on some of this, but since I have no audience, it may not happen too soon.</p>",

If you don&#039;t get immediately up and ride off, people think you&#039;re dead.  That might end up being a problem.  Therefore, it&#039;s best to just hop back on that bike, and ride off.  As I rode off, I thought about that Neosporin commercial (the one where the kid crashes on her bike, and her mother gives her some neosporin).  That kid had a big cut on her chin (much bigger than mine, so it could be worse).  It really made me think about neosporin commercials, though.  They always show comparisons of cuts with neosporin and without, and they are identical cuts.  How the hell do they do that?  Do they pay people to get scarred for life, or is it makeup?  I don&#039;t know which is worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p title='I was probably just thinking about that just to keep from thinking about how painfully embarrassed I was'>Just makes you think. . .</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

The story is extremely engaging, and the facial animations of the characters really makes me believe that they have their own emotions and feelings.  It is an amazing spectacle.  Half Life 2 is the dawning of a new age of computer games.  It gives you a glimpse at the limitless possibilities that computer games have.  Instead of simple diversions, games could be glorious works of art, comperable to any movie, and much more engaging.  It&#039;s a testament to the power that computers have.

      "text": "\n\n<p>Okay, so Thanksgiving was great.  Here&#039;s the scoop:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Check out the rest of my site, too, because I made a bunch of little tweaks, changes, and I have hidden lots of <b title='Try the notch of of my &#039;initial G&#039;'>cool suprises</b>.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I remember the drawn out Thanksgiving hype that I was forced to engage in in elementary school.  I remember the story (probably mostly untrue) about the 'Pilgrims' having a feast <b title='on'>with</b> the 'Indians'.  I remember the story of the <i>Mayflower</i> and her uneventful voyage to <b title='Freedom to prosecute whoever you wanted, maybe'>religious freedom</b>.  The weird thing about this Thanksgiving is that I live on a college campus, and I live here with several <b title='Asian'>foreign</b> students.  I think that most Americans take for granted the fact that we are the only group who celebrates the holiday.  One of my foreign friends asked me what Thanksgiving was all about.  It made me think about kindergarten.  I was suprised that I was telling someone the story, instead of someone telling it to me.  Yet a vast majority of humans don&#039;t even know it exists.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Then I went home</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>THE DOG</b> My parents got this new dog.  It&#039;s a mix between a rotweiler and a groundhog.  No, actually it&#039;s rotweiler/german shepherd, but it does look like a groundhog.  It likes to chew.  It especially likes to chew on people.  Hopefully it will get past that and realize that it really hurts when a dog chews on you.  His name is Theadore Edward Bear, or <b>Ted E. Bear</b> for short.  Or Tedward, for really short.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>THE FAMILY</b> The <b title='My Mom, My Dad, My sister, and I'>four</b> of us went up to Lafayette for thanksgiving day.  My mom&#039;s mom lives there, so we weren&#039;t just going to Purdue for thanksgiving.  We ate at this huge Thanksgiving banquet that some place has every year.  It was really good food, and I wish that I could have eaten more, but I have just had less and less appetite lately.  It really made me mad that I wasn&#039;t able to eat as much as I wanted.  Oh well, that&#039;s a different story.  After we left Grandma&#039;s house at about 4 PM, we headed to my Dad&#039;s brother&#039;s house for the other half of Thanksgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>On the way there, we almost got in a huge crash with a car that was running a stoplight (we had a green light).  They looked at us like they were extremely mad at us, and when we drove around them, they turned across several lanes of traffic and started tailing us!  They were about six inches from our back bumper, and if it wasn&#039;t for my father&#039;s excellent action movie quality driving skills, they would have probably pulled out various assault rifles and shot us to pieces.  It was a very weird experience for a Thanksgiving evening.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>We finally got to Uncle Dan&#039;s house, and everyone had already finished eating.  We were really late because we were at my other Grandma&#039;s house all day.  My uncle flew in from California, and my other uncle drove in from Denver, so everyone was there.  All seven siblings of the McGill family, their spouses, and children.  It was a wild several hours.  I talked to some of my relatives, but unfortunaltely I wasn&#039;t able to really talk to most of them.  The space was limited, and so are my slowly-developing social skills right now.  Most of the time was spent playing wild and crazy games of improvosation with all of my cousins (there are many).  It was a lot of fun.  I hadn&#039;t seen my cousins from California in about six years, and I hardly recognized them; I also hadn&#039;t seen my cousins from Denver in a while.  I went to Denver a couple summers ago, and I had a great time with Sean and Lake, my cousins.  It was great just goofing around with everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>A couple days earlier, I was watching <i>Oprah</i> and Jim Carrey was on.  He is one of my idols, and for a while I wanted to be just like him when I grow up.  I find it so amazing that he can do funny things just non-stop.  As I watched the show, I wished that I could be that funny all the time.  While we were goofing around at Dan&#039;s house, I realized that I was that funny with them.  To my cousins (who are all younger than me by quite a bit), I <i>am</i> Jim Carrey.  Whenever I feel bummed out, like nobody likes me, all I have to do is remember that with that group of people, I am a celebrity.  From all of my cousins looking up to me (well, they literally do, I am 6&#039;8' after all), to all of my uncles and aunts interrested in my computer animation work, I feel so wanted.  Everybody needs something like that.  I can&#039;t wait till Christmas so I can see all of them again.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>People were at our house from Wednesday night, all the way to Saturday night.  It was nonstop action.  It was one of the greatest weekends ever.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>THE INCREDIBLES</b> I also got a chance to watch <i>The Incredibles</i>, the new movie from Pixar.  As somebody who does computer animation, paticularly skeletal character animation, I can tell you that it is the most amazing movie ever made.  Pixar was able to capture every nuance, every little detail about each character.  The animation was the greatest piece of work that I have ever seen.  The graphical detail was also superb.  The hair was amazing, the shadows an lighting was perfect, the models were spot-on, the voice acting was excellent, etc. etc.  It really is quite Incredible.  Now my parents are going to drag me to the Polar Express, which looks stupid.  It just looks like the creators wanted to show how cool computer graphics are.  In every clip I have seen about that movie, somebody&#039;s doing a backflip.  They need a decent story before they can create a good movie.  <b title='too much motion capture'>Plus they cheated</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>All of my relatives watched the movie with me, and after it was over, they started asking me all sorts of questions about how it was done.  Being a freshman in Computer Graphics I didn&#039;t really know, but I was able to make up enough stuff that sounded right!  I also want to mention that every time the HP commercial comes on where the guy has picture frames and they magically have pictures of him in them, my relatives ask me how they did that.  I think I know, but I can&#039;t really explain it too well.  It gets a litle annoying after a while.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>THE RETURN</b>When I finally got back to school, I wished that I could just stay home, where every one loves me, and I have a great time all the time.  The problem is that life isn&#039;t always like that.  Usually, life consists of being made fun of and always trying way too hard to keep your dignity.  For me anyway.  I constantly have to have an argument like 'No, the GeForce 6800 isn&#039;t as good as the x800 XT!' or 'yeah, that nForce 4 is going to rock' or whatever.  Everything is a posturing battle of pontification.  Maybe the problem is that I don&#039;t really have any friends outside the dorm, or maybe the problem is that I don&#039;t have a girlfriend.  I don&#039;t know.  I only have one week of classes left this semester, and I can&#039;t believe just how fast it&#039;s going.  This really is one of the greatest times of my life, and it&#039;s blazing at breakneck speed.  It&#039;s weird that we never do anything on weekends.  For example, this weekend I am really looking forward to reformatting my computer, and reinstalling windows with a secondary boot of Gentoo Linux.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I need a girlfriend.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "<p>I feel like crap</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I just played my first game of Wallyball (volleyball in a raquetball court).  It was awesome.  I don&#039;t know if it was the cold outside, or the physical excersize, or the fact that I have a slight cold, or the fact that I haven&#039;t gotten enough sleep lately, or a mixture of all of them, but I really felt bad when I got back from the game.  I wanted to lie down, but I couldn&#039;t because my bed is too hard to climb into (when you feel really bad).  I was walking to the bathroom, and I started to loose my grip on reality.  I shut my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Like a dream, I heard something collapse on the floor.  As I layed there in the middle of the hall, the world swimming around me, I just wondered what was going to happen next.  First, I had to find out why I was on the floor, which was easy when I coupled the collapsing noise with the fact that I was, in fact, collapsed.  Then I had to start thinking about moving somewhere else.  I didn&#039;t want to get up, but as I have said in earlier posts, <i>you absolutely cannot stay on the ground when you fall down, otherwise people will think that you are dead</i>.  The thing is, though, that I was actually in physical duress, and I might have needed actual help.  At what point is it okay to stay collapsed?  When I am actually dead?  At any rate, I was able to acheive enough cohesion to realize that someone opened the door at the end of the hall, so I looked up at them, and sort of wiggled to the side.  You know, like it was completely normal that I was laying in the hallway.  This might be a problem for me.  Even when I am collapsed in the hallway, I still have to worry about my environment.  I knew that no matter what, I had to go somewhere else.  Luckily I was recomposed enough to say that my room was too warm, and it was more comfortable in the hallway.  I was able to climb into my bed, and lie down.  I am fine now.  Fine enough, anyway.  It was really wierd, though.  Now I have to get ready to talk to my parents, who will undoubtedly freak out when they read this.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The Saturday night movie tonight is Master of Disguise (one of the worst/greatest movies ever).  That will cheer me up.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I saw <i>Garden State</i> today.  It is a really great movie.  It shows Natalie Portman&#039;s amazing talents well.  She is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.  She is an amazing actress, she was in Star Wars, and she goes to an Ivy League school.  That is really attractive.  Anyway, the movie really made me rethink a lot of things about my life.  The new plans are still forming in my mind (perhaps their complexity caused my mind to lock up earlier), perhaps the future will show new outlooks on life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>time for sleep now</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

While thinking about it, I realized that there really weren&#039;t any good roleplaying games this year.  That suprized me a little, considering that we usually get a couple D&D games at least.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>And another thing, <i>Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i> is a great game, except for the fact that it is full of bugs.  It is the second game to have Half Life 2&#039;s source engine, and it shows just how much work went into polishing Half Life 2.  Even the opening cutscene of <i>Bloodlines</i> was so full of bugs that all we can do is laugh at it.  There are so many bugs, glitches, half-assed work, bsp holes, and annoyances that it turns a terrific game and terrific engine into a merely noteworthy B-level game.  I almost hear Marlin Brandow saying 'I could&#039;a been somebody, I could&#039;a been a contender.' This game really could have been an amazing achievement.  With the most powerful engine, very well developed gameplay, and an intriguing and twisting storyline, this really could have been a good game.  If only they had taken an extra year to smooth out all the bugs.  It&#039;s a shame, but also a good motivational example for games to come.</p>",

Several years ago, I wanted nothing but to be a professional actor.  I gave that up, but I still loved performing.  I actually promised people that I would get into <b>the theatre department here at Purdue</b>.  I wish I hadn&#039;t now.  I see what professional theatre is like.  It&#039;s distilled, taken down to it&#039;s root elements.  It&#039;s examined, picked apart, and looked at with a mathematical eye.  It is no longer an art, it is a <i>science</i>.  I can&#039;t deal with that.  It <b>sucks</b>.  Would we take a <b>Davinci</b> apart like that?  Someone probably has.  I don&#039;t understand it.  For me, theatre is a chance for me to have a place in society.  It gives me a <b>purpose</b>.  All too often in my life, I feel lost because I don&#039;t know what to say, or I don&#039;t feel like myself.  When I perform, I know <b>exactly what to say</b>, and <b>exactly who to be</b>.  Sometimes I feel like it&#039;s the only thing I do really well, but I can&#039;t do it, and will likely never again do it.  I made a choice.  I chose <b>computer graphics</b> over <b>theatre</b>.  That was my decision, and it will turn out okay in the long run.  Everyone has to leave the <b>hundred-achre wood</b> at some point.  I now have to decide if I should drop the theatre minor, because it is totally not going to help me like I <b>thought</b> it would.

Perhaps the best feature is that it costs the same as one of the doubles, per person.

      "title": "Sex can wait, Rasturbate!",
      "text": "<p>I came across a really cool web site.  It&#039;s called the 'rasturbator.'  Before you start coming up with gross things that 'rasturbater' could mean, I will tell you.  The site allows you to upload any picture of your choice, and it will blow it up, rasterize it (turn it into hundreds of little dots), and format it for print on a bunch of letter sized paper.  We found a nice picture of Keira Knightley, and 'rasturbated' it (we had a lot of fun telling random people that we were rasturbating).  I have some great pictures, if you will just</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>click here . . .</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ok, so there&#039;s this web site.  It&#039;s called <a href =' http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/'>the Rasturbator</a>, and it is totally cool.  Any web site that lets my friends and I yell sexual innuendo that isn&#039;t really innuendo is an awesome web site.  We needed something to liven up the hallway, because we were getting sick of the drab white walls, also the smell was getting pretty bad.  'Lets get some hot chicks and put them up on the walls,' we said.  What we meant, of course, was 'Some artful posters would be a nice contrast to the shades of grey present in this environment.'  We&#039;re always so concious of good design.  'Yeah, let&#039;s rasterbate (giggle) all over the wall (giggle).'  <i>Come on, we&#039;re 18 year old college guys, what do you expect us to say?</i>  We wanted to eventually have rasturbations (giggle) all up and down the hall, covering the entire hallway.  How totally awesome would that be?  Seriously.  So we did a google image search for a good picture of Keira Knightley, who we all adore so much.  Here&#039;s the image we selected:</p>\r\n\r\n\t<a href='../assets/images/keira.jpg'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/keirathumb.jpg' align='left' hspace='5' /></a>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Now, if this picture is offensive to anyone, please let me know.  I didn&#039;t think it would be a problem, which is why I selected Keira for this thing in the first place.  I didn&#039;t think anyone would be offended by pure un-flawed beauty, but, you know, it takes all kinds.  I though anyone who had a problem with this picture had problems of their own, because beauty this pure should not cause that response.  Anyway, we uploaded the image to the site, and made the measurements to come up with the size of the full image.  The final rasturbation (giggle) ended up using 72 sheets of standard letter sized paper.  We went on down to the computer lab (yes, you read that right) to print off the 72 sheets of pointillistic beauty.  We got the whole thing to print, giggling at the lab assistant the whole time.  Eventually our RA (we have a new RA named Zawar) came in and asked us what the hell we were doing, but we just giggled at him.  We were a little freaked out when we realized that each sheet of paper was not printed to the edge (of course), so we would need to hand-cut every single sheet to get them all to the right size.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>At this point, we had a pretty big group of people watching us, because it was a pretty cool thing, after all.  We gathered up the bundle, and started taping it to the wall, right outside my room.  Among the group of bystanders was a bunch of people from our hall, a few random girls, and Zawar himself (clear proof to us that we wouldn&#039;t get in trouble for it).  The final measurement came out to 7&#039;7' tall by about 4&#039;6' wide.  That&#039;s really big, by the way.  Everyone who saw it thought it was awesome.  People would walk though the hall, and right when they finished saying 'this hall smells like crap' they would see the poster, and then they would say 'wow, this hall is awesome.'  Mission: accomplished?  Unfortunately, not quite.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>IMAGE BONANZA!!!!</b></p>\r\n\r\n\t<a href='../assets/images/raster001.jpg'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/raster1thumb.jpg' title='The assembly.  Those are Zawar&#039;s legs propped on that chair.' /></a>\r\n\t<a href='../assets/images/raster002.jpg'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/raster2thumb.jpg' title='The finished rasturbation.  SO GORGEOUS!!' /></a>\r\n\t<a href='../assets/images/raster003.jpg'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/raster3thumb.jpg' title='Fred was really proud of a job well done.' /></a>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Ok, so now the bad news.  Zawar told us that as long as Jason (the head RA) is okay with it, it will stay.  We all figured that it would be okay, because we made it through an entire day with no removal-order.  Then at about 5 oclock, we get the bad news.  Zawar told us that we need to remove it, but that we could talk to Jason about it.  So we decided to talk to Jason about it.  It was a lot of work and awesomeness to just tear down.  Jason was an absolute asshole, though.  He just flat out told us, 'it&#039;s coming down, no question, you&#039;re taking it down.'  We guessed that he was in a hurry, and we decided to talk to him on Monday (it was Friday at the time).  Later we get the order that it has to come down by Friday night.  Mission: Failed.  damn.  First the men&#039;s sign, then the giant poster.  What was his reasoning?  It was a fire hazard, and could be offensive to someone.  Right.  As if.  I ended up having to take it down, and I put it on my ceiling, over my bed (the only place large enough for it).  So now I look like some kind of weirdo with this huge picture right over my bed, but whatever.  It was fun, and it gave us something to do for a while.  Immediately after I took it down, someone was walking through the hall, and wondered where it went.  He doesn&#039;t even live here, but he was still mad that it came down.</p>\r\n",

Why is it that people try to be motivational with stupid taglines like that, when the only useful application for it is a <b>mediocre dessert</b>.

I am in desperate need of a dream, like that one where <b>Natalie Portman</b> was in my kitchen at home.

      "text": "<p>When I graduated from high school, I vowed that I would never return to that <b>awful place</b>.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, Mt Vernon High School isn&#039;t the <b title='I hear that Northern Siberia is a little cold this time of year.'>worst place in the world</b>, it&#039;s just that high school wasn&#039;t my paticular cup of tea. I was so quick to forget high school, that I didn&#039;t even attend my own commencement, a fact that I <b>doubt</b> I will ever regret. The last thing I want is something that will make me start to worry about the trappings and chore of a high school student once again.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Imagine my suprise, then, when I found myself doing exactly that.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>There&#039;s a hubbub going on in my hometown. It&#039;s a hubbub that threatens to consume the enire population in an epic stuggle, the likes of which haven&#039;t been seen since -- well, since the Bush administration came into office.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>What could it be?  Click here if you dare.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>All of the schools in the east-central Indiana area are balooning up more than a Thanksgiving day Parade.  These gigantic high schools are cropping up everywhere.  It&#039;s insane, the amount of students that are moving to the area.  Not to be outdone, Mt. Vernon school corporation has done some expansion of its own in the last couple years. To kick things off, Mt Vernon was proud to announce their new, <b>multi-milion dollar football statium</b> two years ago. They also just built a huge 'intermediate school' for just the 5th and 6th graders, further increasing the <b>age seggregation</b> of modern public schools. Currently under construction, the McCordsville elementary will add to the sepparation of students along town borders. Indeed, it would seem that the Superintendant, <b>Dr. William Riggs</b> will not stop until he has divided every student into a sepparate school, and sucked every last penny of tax money from the parents.</p>\r\n\t<p>Oh, how I wish I was kidding.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>It would seem that <b title='Direct Quote from the MVCSC website'>'raising academic achievement for all students'</b> includes the construction of multi-million dollar buildings. The administration announced late last year their plans for their capricious new additions for the 'old &#039;n busted' high school and existing elementaries. Included in this plan is a <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>$60 million addition</b> to the high school, a <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>$27 million dollar addition</b> to the two elementary schools, <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>$16 million for a new gym, pool, and auditorium</b> for the high school,  a <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>technology center</b>, <i>and</i> a <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>new bus garage</b>. First off, the school system has an auditorium, a pool, a bus garage, and a whopping <i>7 gyms</i> at its disposal already. I&#039;m sorry if all of this seems a little redundant to me. The grand total for the whole project, according to the administration (and keep in mind that prices are very often not met, projects usually go over budget), is <b>136 million dollars</b>.  That does <b>not</b> include the two schools recently built, or the football stadium. Just to keep things in perspective, Conseco Fieldhouse, which is a multi-purpose arena for a professional basketball team, cost 174 million dollars (a difference of. . . 38 million dollars). Mt. Vernon school corp. services about <b title='From the September 9th Schoolboard Minutes'>3,191</b> students, which is one of the smallest corporations in the area, whereas the Fieldhouse can seat <b title='Straight from the official Fieldhouse site'>18,345</b>. Maybe those two things don&#039;t really compare, but it&#039;s worth noting.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><i>Big deal</i>, you say. <i>So what</i>, you might scoff. A school is entitled to spend some money on 'raising academic achievement for all students' if it wants to. If you find yourself saying those things, you might just want to listen to this. The proposed addition, all told, will increase property taxes of everyone in the area an estimated <b title='From mvtaxpayers.org'>60 - 85 percent</b> from current levels over the next six years. What are your property taxes, I ask. Say you owe about $1,100 every year (that&#039;s when you don&#039;t count that storage shed as another structure). If you happened to be living in the Vernon township area over the next six years, and this whole deal goes through, you could be owing another $935. That&#039;s almost a <b>thousand dollars more</b> that you will have to pay each year just for living in the Vernon township area. What if you have a hundred acres of farmland? What if you can&#039;t afford that? What if you don&#039;t have any children, and you couldn&#039;t care less about paying for Dr. Riggs&#039;s new gym?</p>\r\n\t<p>According to Dr. Riggs himself: <b>Tough Noogies.</b></p>\r\n\t<p>Okay, that&#039;s not a direct quote, but it would be easier for him to just say that. If you live in that northern Hancock county area that is Vernon Township, you <b>will</b> have to pay those taxes, <b>without question</b>. The expansion plans went through the school board with a vote of 3-1 in favor, without even questioning the taxpayers opinion. <b>Tough noogies, indeed</b>. Dr. Riggs was so convinced that the plan would go through without problem that he didn&#039;t even make the effort to ask anyone their opinion. The plan was given with the voice of someone who has no uncertainty, no question about whether or not taxpayers will be willing to pay for it or not. What&#039;s worse is that <b>it worked</b>. The football stadium was getting boring, the intermediate school was already collecting dust. Riggs was bored, and wanted some new project to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>And what of those sad residents of Vernon Township who will have to pay for his new diversion? The residents, of which my parents are proud members, <b>will be forced</b> to deal with this plan. Or will they? A small band of residents, a Rebel Alliance if you will, has risen up and declared a <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=remonstrance' title='Definition' class='black'>remonstrance</a> on the evil Mt. Vernon Empire. A petition has gone around collecting signatures of people who don&#039;t want to pay an additional 85% in property taxes. The petition has a very good chance of getting enough signatures. Two distinct factions <b title='Passive voice.  I know, mom!'>have formed</b>. The members of the remonstrance, and their blue forms are facing off against the proponents of the plan, and their yellow forms. It is an epic struggle between the 'blue forms' and the 'yellow forms.' Needless to say, the <b>blue formers</b> have a lot of strong information backing up their position. Like the Rebel Alliance of a long time ago, the blue formers just might win this war. I really hope that Riggs is shaking in his 'academic achievement' boots, because he&#039;s next. I hope he doesn&#039;t drop his <b>beloved golden cross</b> on his way out.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Why am I so up at arms about this? After all, I did promise myself that I wouldn&#039;t concern myself with that place any more. I don&#039;t go there anymore, and don&#039;t pay any property taxes. So what&#039;s the problem? <b>My parents</b>, though they have no more students to drag throught the gauntlet, <b>still have to pay for the construction</b>. <i title='For, um, books! Yeah, books!'>That is money that they could be giving me!</i> Seriously, though, this goes so much farther than Fortville, Indiana. Mt. Vernon&#039;s construction plan brings a whole new moral dilema to the game. Far more important than whether or not to allow the <b>Ten Commandments</b> in the classroom, far more important than capital punishment, is the concept of the business of public education. No longer does Mt. Vernon care about preparing students for the world, not that I really think they ever did. No, Riggs is far more concerned with <b>'raising personal wealth achievement for himself.'</b> That is why I care, and why you should, too.  If this plan goes through, how many more schools will follow this example?</p>\r\n\t<p>I know I&#039;m bitter. I know I went through Hell to fill Riggses&#039; wallet. I know that with the proper application of adjectives, a <b>web logger</b> can make any subject look bad. Still, $1000 dollars a year for life is a large price to pay for a gratuitous gym. <b>You can&#039;t argue with that.</b></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p> </p>\r\n\t<p>For more information on the remonsterance, visit <a href='http://www.mvtaxpayers.org'>mvtaxpayers.org</a></p>\r\n\t<p>If you doubt any of my facts, just hold the mouse on them and a tooltip will pop up telling you where I got the information.</p>\r\n\t<p>Still doubt me?  <a href='mailto:smcgill@purdue.edu' title='If you want to rid the &#039;net of false info, good luck.'>TOUGH NOOGIES!</a></p>",

Where I grew up, in school if you showed any sort of emotion at all, you were quickly tought that 'people do not behave like that.'  Well, I am free from that, and I now have friends who truly care about me.  Friends I truly care about.  When I&#039;m in an unhappy mood now, someone will actually talk to me about what&#039;s bothering me.  My whole life, I always thought to myself, 'college is going to be so awesome,' etc.  First semester, I wouldn&#039;t have agreed with it, but now I sure do.  This past couple months has been the best couple months of my life.  The only thing that could make this any better would be if Star Wars was coming out on my birthday again.  OH WAIT, IT IS!!!!!  Yeah, that totally r0xx0rz.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Seriously, though, the one real downside to this year is pretty blaringly obvious.  I really miss my parents.  They were always there for me.  I could have intelligent conversations with them, without fear of them bashing my ego against the wall.  I feel so bad about the fact that I haven&#039;t called them as much as I could have.  I think the reason I haven&#039;t been thinking about them very much is that if I started thinking about it, I would really begin to realize how much I really do miss them.  I miss eating breakfast with my Dad.  I miss talking to my Mom about school.  I miss playing 'trucks' with my Dad.  I miss having Mom read books to me before I went to sleep.  I miss my Dad&#039;s infinite and artistic craftiness.  I miss my Mom&#039;s ability to write the perfect thing at any time.  Now I&#039;m starting to cry, see?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well, I will have to look forward to this summer, because I will be working with my Dad and his amazing artistic skills, and I will be able to have intelligent conversations with my Mom again.  Before I left, my Mom told me that I would be missing fresh eggs.  I do, Mom.  I do miss your chickens&#039; eggs.  I miss having eggs with every meal.  Even though at the time I was annoyed with your writings and your various schemes, I would give anything to be able to hear what you are working on right now.  Being away has really shown me how amazingly inteligent and wise you guys are.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I guess I&#039;m at a junction in my life.  I am starting to become more of a college student, a purely social individual.  At the same time, I am feeling pain from being torn from my parents and my childhood.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>What&#039;s my point?  It&#039;s actually pretty simple.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I love my wonderful new friends.  More importantly, I love my Mom and Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>You can check out some information about some of my friends (paticularly the ones in my hall) at Lord Ontario&#039;s web site.

      "text": "<p>My family and I went to see <i>Robots</i> last night.  It was really a lousy movie, if you must know.  I don&#039;t know why Newsweek would hail, 'the funniest movie of the year,' because it really wasn&#039;t that funny.  Maybe it&#039;s just me, because I have a weird sense of humor.  I never laugh at the show <i>Family Guy</i>, even when my friends around me are always cracking up.  Even still, comedy does not make a movie, not by any means.  I&#039;m going to compare this movie to the <i>Incredibles</i>, which I don&#039;t agree with at all, but they started it (in their commercial), so they deserve it.  I don&#039;t think that they are in the same league, so it&#039;s hard to compare them.  <i>Robots</i> is not anywhere near the nuance or pure creativity of <I>the Incredibles</i>.  <i>The Incredibles</i> is without at doubt the greatest animated movie of all time, in my opinion.  It just barely edges out <i>Monsters, Inc</i>.  I even consider it to be one of the greatest movies ever made, since it hardly feels like an animation.  <i>Robots</i>, on the other hand, although their commercial would say otherwise, is not a decent movie at all.  Why is that?  What makes the <i>Incredibles</i> so much better than <i>Robots</i>?  Absolutely everything.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Robots has a lousy, predictable script, stupid character development, and just bad planning.  While watching it, I felt like it was more of a series of short animations than a whole movie.  They threw in too many gags to have any sort of consistency in the characters.  Also, where Pixar somehow seems to succeed in every movie they have made, Robots just seems way too cluttered.  Pixar movies have a certain level of detail in every shot, but yet it never seems cluttered or overly complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Unfortunately for Robots, one of its biggest strengths is also what makes it a bad movie.  The animators went to great lengths to make it look spectacular, and indeed it does.  Every scene has outstanding technology, from the huge scale transportation system to the extremely detailed domino sequence.  The problem is that it just seems like the animators were showcasing the capabilities of whatever animation package they were using.  This is the computer animator in me coming out, and I could go on about this movie for a while.  I felt like I was at an expo, and some software company was showcasing their new physics system.  Each scene of the movie felt like a sepparate short animation showcasing a different capability.  The animators did things just because they could, not because it really helped the movie&#039;s plot at all  (not that there was a plot to help).</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I must say, though, that the design work, like the character models and the environments were extremely detailed and well done.  The voice acting was also top notch, but that&#039;s what you would expect when a company spends more on the actors and design then they spend on the script.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>As bad as Robots was, I will say that it was so much better than Shark Tale, or even Shrek, in my opinion.  I thought both of those movies were terrible.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>One important thing to say is this:  before Robots, the theatre showed the new trailor for Episode 3.  It&#039;s worth going just for that.  George Lucas has taken a lot of space-flak for his prequels, and I feel terrible about that.  I loved both Episode 1 and 2, and I&#039;m sure 3 will blow my socks off (along with my feet).  I am going to need to make a post about the prequels, because something needs to be said.  Stay tuned.</p>",

Still, it would be nice if you did.  I know you think that I&#039;m just a foolish kid, blinded by my false impressions of you.  I just don&#039;t understand what you think I have wrong.  I have a million reasons why I love you, most of which I don&#039;t even know or understand.  I went there hoping to find something that would allow me let go, but I only found the opposite.  I lost track of what I want to do with myself.  I lost all purpose in my life.  Maybe things will settle down and I will be fine in a little bit, but as I walk along these open roads, not one single thing will ever make me forget what an amazing person you are, and no one will ever win my heart from you.  I don&#039;t feel like I was able to really tell you how I feel.  I have all these thoughts that I wanted to express, but I couldn&#039;t express them.  I wanted to tell you everything, but I couldn&#039;t put it to words.  I must have told you 'like' or 'you know' like 500 times, you know?  For a year, I would have given anything to be able to see you. Now, all I want is just to be able to never see you again.  As it is, I will have to find my way down there again to get another few minutes to try.  Another few minutes to try and express myself.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I don&#039;t know why I feel like this.  I don&#039;t know what to do.  Why do I always get the feeling like nobody really wants me around?  I wish I could spend the rest of my life in her arms.  Not because I love her, but because when she hugs me, for that moment, I stop feeling un-wanted.  Any time I am with people, a part of me constantly tells me that they don&#039;t want me there.  I wish I could spend the rest of my life hugging her.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>She was the one who told me that when I go to college I won&#039;t have a real home anymore.  Like everything she told me, it is profoundly true.  I&#039;m home for spring break, and I just feel like I am in the way.  I feel like I am breaking up everyone&#039;s routine.  Yet, I can&#039;t really call Purdue my home, especially now that I am having second thoughts about enrolling there.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I need to stop second guessing myself all the time.  I need to stop thinking that I am so inferior to everyone else.  I need to forget about her and move on.  Right?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you want to know why I love you so much, all you have to do is just give me a call.  You can&#039;t ever do that, though, can you?  I can&#039;t even be mad at you, because I understand and respect why you do everything you do.  I need to just stop thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I want the old days back, when I saw you every day and you laughed at my jokes even when you didn&#039;t immediately get them.</p>",

      "text": "<p>The other day, I was walking back from a class, and I noticed a sign on the sidewalk that said 'everystudent.com.' It was just an orange laser jet printing with white text, taped to the sidewalk with ordinary masking tape. I thought nothing of it. A lot of people tape signs to sidewalks on campus, and nobody pays much attention to them. Students just walk on them, and eventually those poor signs are ripped apart by the repeated stress of the students&#039; unforgiving shoes. I occasionally see groundskeepers working frantically to scrape the tape off of the sidewalk, a futile gesture because more signs always come to replace their torn and trampled brothers. It&#039;s interesting that a major marketing scheme at Purdue relies on the knowledge that most students keep their heads down while they walk. The basic bowed head is commonplace, it seems. Anyway, that&#039;s a different matter. I saw this sign a couple days ago, and I wondered what 'everystudent.com' actually is. I assumed that it was some sort of student organization, to give students something to do besides drink and make out with each other. In my head, I saw students spending every second of free time surfing this 'everystudent.com' for some social fix that would keep them going another couple minutes. I immediately ignored the sign, like I do with most items of that nature. I have found that if I just ignore those types of people, they will ignore me. They will keep their heads down, and go on with their lives like they hadn&#039;t just seen a guy who actually has a different colored sock on each foot. It turns out that I wasn&#039;t completely wrong about 'everystudent.com,' but I did underestimate it by a grand margin.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Turns out, it&#039;s a cult.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I should warn you all that what I&#039;m about to say will definitely offend a lot of you, so consider yourself warned.  I don&#039;t want to get into any arguments about this, and I will not talk to anyone who just wants to tell me how wrong I am.  So there.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Christianity is an interesting religion.  It&#039;s one of the only religions to actually lead followers to kill people who don&#039;t believe in it.  Nothing is more blunt than the Crusades.  You can&#039;t deny that.  A lot of people would say that the whole 9/11 thing is a result of religion, but it really isn&#039;t.  People from another religion kill us, and so we immediately figure that it was because of that religion.  Islam is not a violent thing.  Christians were the ones who formed armies and went to the Middle East to slaughter anyone who gets in their way.  That&#039;s pretty violent.  The whole mentality still exists.  When word got out that I am not a Christian in High School, people freaked out.  I had people constantly trying to convert me.  My Christian friends actually have a hard time being friends with someone who doesn&#039;t believe exactly what they do.  I just don&#039;t understand that.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>One of the most popular student committees here at Purdue is a group called 'Campus Crusade.'  Yes, they are die-hard Christians, and no they don&#039;t slaughter people who stand in their way.  At least we&#039;ve gotten more civilized than that.  These people, although I have lived with them mostly peacefully for my entire life, really scare me.  The word 'cult' comes to mind.  Here&#039;s where a lot of people are going to frantically run to their email providers and hit the 'caps-lock' key.  I am entitled to my opinion, especially on the internet, so deal with it.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Today at dinner, everyone had a red t-shirt with the words &#039;everystudent.com&#039; printed on the front.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ok, so not everyone, but honestly a majority of the people in the dining hall had one of these shirts.  My friends and I were just wondering what they meant.  We started noticing more and more red shirts.  At one point, I turned and a girl was walking past, so I was looking right at one of these shirts.  I honestly screamed.  I think it scared her, but I couldn&#039;t help it.  It was really scary.  Only a couple days ago I just heard of this thing, and now almost everyone has a t-shirt proclaiming that they are &#039;every student.&#039;  What the Hell does that even mean?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Well, I have since found out that these shirts are the workings of the campus crusade.  That did not help abate my fears.  I had a feeling all along that the crusade had their hand in this somewhere, and it turns out that they do.  A glance at the web site doesn&#039;t help my fears, either.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>Christianity seems to be the only religion that tries to stuff their ideals down non-believers&#039; throats.  One of the first things on their site is a link that says, &#039;Is There a God?&#039;  Their list of six &#039;straight forward&#039; reasons to believe in God is all very ridiculous, in my opinion.  What is their primary reason to believe in God?  Throughout history, in all cultures of the world, people have been convinced there is a God.  Basically, you should believe in God because everyone else does.  I&#039;m not an Atheist.  I do believe in God, so I&#039;m not discounting His existence.  I am, however, refusing to believe in their reasons.  Their reason to believe in God is like saying &#039;I believe in Darth Vader because the special effects in Star Wars are so good.&#039;  They say that God exists because the Bible says so.  Whatever.  I don&#039;t care.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>They are entitled to believe what they believe, just like I am.  However, I am not proclaiming my beliefs to be those of &#039;every student.&#039;  That is what offends me about this.  I do not, and I will not, believe what they believe.  Therefore, it cannot possibly be &#039;every student.&#039;  What about the high population of Muslims, Jews, and Hindus who go to Purdue?  They are obviously a part of the pronoun &#039;every student.&#039;  They aren&#039;t Christian, though, so the entire thought that this is &#039;every student&#039; is ridiculous.  I really hope that Hillel (the Jewish student group) speaks up about this.  Someone needs to speak up about this.  Instead of worrying about the smoking ban (which will come into effect next year), we should worry about the Christianity problem.  Freedom of religion, anyone?  And for all of you people ready to click &#039;send&#039; on your all-caps email, how about a little freedom of speech?  I don&#039;t want to have to make t-shirts that say &#039;church = cult&#039; or &#039;don&#039;t drink the koolade&#039;  but I will.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>There are schools for Christian students, so you all can go to one of those if you want every student to believe exactly what you do.</p>\r\n",

(I&#039;ll try not to cuss too terribly much)</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><b>Shut up about <i>Star Wars</i>.</b></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Oh, I&#039;m not even kidding about this one, people.  I am getting so incredibly sick and tired of all this ridiculous negativity toward the <b>prequels</b>.  I happen to love the new movies, thank you.  I find <b>nothing wrong</b> with Hayden Christensen.  George Lucas is making the movies the way that he wants to make them, whether you like it or not.  I swear, the next time someone complains about Hayden Christensen, I am really going to have to try hard to <b>NOT</b> punch them in the face.  This just really calls for a big heaping bowl of <a href='http://www.stfu.se/' title='I didn&#039;t even make this.' class='black'><b>STFU</b></a>.  I&#039;m really sick of these <b>stuck up assholes</b> who happen to be experts on absolutely every single little thing in the world making <b>ridiculous complaints</b> about everything.  You know what?  I&#039;m pretty sure we all have <b>opinions</b>, so you aren&#039;t really that special just because you happen to have one.  We have to live with the way George Lucas makes his movies.  If you think they should be made differently, you can just <b>go ahead and make your own movies</b>.  There&#039;s the real problem with your arguments.  You can say all the bullshit you want, but I can shoot it all down at once simply by saying <i>well, make your own movies, then</i>.  If you would just take a look at how much work has gone into a film series like <i>Star Wars</i>, you might just realize that you could never create anything with the <b>creative power</b> or <b>storytelling mastery</b> that George Lucas has.  I can&#039;t wait for <i>Episode 3</i>, but I am really dreading all of the nonsense that everyone is going to spout just because it didn&#039;t live up to their <b>outrageous expectations</b>.  Let&#039;s just end it with this:  I love the entire <i>Star Wars</i> series;  not because they are particularly amazing works of film, but simply because they are the expression of the creative energies of so many people.  I have no expectations for <i>Episode 3</i> because it will be what it is, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Get some goddamn acting training, and <b>THEN</b> you can tell me how horrible all of the acting is in the prequels. Guess what:  The original movies weren&#039;t exactly powerhouse acting performances, either, you know.  <b>End of Rant.</b></p>",

      "text": "\t\t\t\t<p>It seems that my life might  be changing. Turns out, it was there all along, and I was just blind to it. That&#039;s the way, I guess. I hate to be a jackass and talk about how great I am, but hey, we&#039;re all great. I am special. Everyone is special. I don&#039;t care how I feel tomorrow, because for this moment, I love life again. I know I will go down again, but I don&#039;t care. For this moment, my apathy is paying off.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Friends are really important. They really come in handy when you need someone to pull you out of quicksand. My eyes had just passed the waterline, and I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers. I hadn&#039;t seen her standing there, so I didn&#039;t know she was trying to save me. I could feel the cold sand filling my nostrils. The black grip of unconciousness was slowly rolling over me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers, and I ran my hand along the fragile bark. The tree branch felt like a dream, like my mind was wishfully imagining the sensation of being saved. There was no bottom to the sand. I reached with my feet, trying to find a piece of hard ground to balance my weight on. With every movement, I just sank deeper and deeper into my watery grave, my desperate feet killing me in their attempt to save me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers, and I could feel the cold touch of the old wood. It was an old stick, one that had broken off of a tree long ago. The branch was discarded as dead weight, cast aside to allow the tree to grow. The branch was dead. It was still a sturdy branch, strong enough to pull someone out of a pit of quicksand. I was handed the broken end of the branch, and I could feel the severed joint where once stood the trunk of a great tree. The slightly rotted wood was somewhat soft to the touch, and bits of the fragile bark crumbled off at my grip.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers, and in an instant I clenched my fist around the discarded branch of a tree. I felt it pull, but my body was too entrenched in the sand to be moved. A second pull, this time much more forcefully that the first, and I began to feel the pressure of being pulled against the force of gravity. She leaned back, and put her entire weight against the stick. I hadn&#039;t seen her standing there; I didn&#039;t know anyone was there to save me. I felt my head break the surface of the sand, and I could feel the cool spring air against my wet skin. My eyes came to the water line once again, and I opened them. The bright morning sun burst through the canopy of  the forest. My eyes squinted under the rays of light being cast through the bare branches of the trees. I didn&#039;t think I would ever use my eyes again, so the renewed sensation was shocking at first. Once my eyes adjusted, I could see the canopy more clearly. I was able to notice that the branches weren&#039;t entirely bare. Tiny green buds were beginning to grow on the grey wood, and I could already see life beginning to course through the old growth once again.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers. This branch was not alive. It had no green buds growing on its surface, and life was not coursing through it&#039;s dark, rotting wood. This dead thing, the most lifeless thing in the forest, was renewing my existence. Soon, as if green buds were growing on my skin, life would be once again coursing through my body. I would be able to live once again, and all because of this dead, rotting wood. I was saved by a dead branch, and, of course, the girl.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I hadn&#039;t seen her standing there, so I didn&#039;t know someone was there to save me. My eyes ran along the length of the stick to her soft hands, and then up to the most enchanting pair of eyes I have ever seen. This perfect angelic woman was standing there, straining with the stick in her soft hands, saving my life. This perfect angelic woman, with skin like the softest most pure silk, was giving me the chance to live again. This perfect angelic woman, with golden hair that fell on her cheeks in the most gentle caring manner, saved me at the last possible moment. My arm reached out, and I felt the hard surface of the forest floor. I pulled my body onto firm ground. She crouched over my body, the most amazing example of caring and compassion the universe has ever seen. She brushed the sand away from my face, and I realized that I was covered head to toe in millions of grains of moist sand. Touching my chin, she lifted my face to line up with hers. At this moment, I knew the extent of the universe. At this moment, I saw how vast our universe really is. I saw every nuance and detail just by gazing at the reflection of the forest in her pale blue eyes. We sat there for an eternety, staring at the extents of the universe. Her face was youthful, its slender curves forming together into the most beautifully gentle thing I have ever seen. I have seen her face before. I have seen her face in my dreams, when I dream of angels. I have seen her face in dreams, when I dream of heaven. I suddenly feared that I had died in the sand, and this woman was a lovely creature come to welcome me to my afterlife. 'Are you ok?' Her voice echoed through my head. I told her I was, and then she kissed me gently on the cheek. Truly, I know what it is to be a flower in summer, with a soft beautiful butterfly resting peacefully on its petals. Truly, I know what it is to be a fresh ripe peach, with a drop of morning dew resting peacefully on its skin. Her kiss was like a butterfly, her lips were like drops of dew, resting peacefully on my cheek. Her embrace was the wind itself wrapping around me, protecting and loving me. She saved my life, and simultaneously allowed me to live a lifetime of happiness in a single moment.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I felt the stick touch my outstreached fingers. My life and breath, renewed.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>I am somewhat scared by change.  Monumental things, like moving away from my parents, whom I had never left for more than 3 days, and going to a completely foreign world.  Those things scare me, sure.  Those things scare everyone.  More so, the small things scare me, too.  Small things, like going from a state of warm comfort to a shivering wet mess.  Those things scare me, too.  Today Neal, Chris, and I went for a 'fountain run' where we went to the fountain by Beering hall and ran through it.  At first, Chris and I stood there looking at the gushing water, thinking that maybe it wasn&#039;t a good idea.  Neal, soking wet from head to toe (except for the freak strip of dryness down his left leg) tried to push us into the spray.  The sun glared down, but it somehow felt less warm, the breeze was cold, as if to say, <i>don&#039;t do it.</i>  We watched the children run around the fountain, and I admired their ability to throw their cares to that nagging wind.  You can&#039;t explain what it is like to run through the liberal arts fountain at Purdue University.  It is an amazing sensation.  Jets of water are bombarding you from every possible angle, and you are instantly soaking wet.  Once I took that first step, the fears were gone, and I was concentrating more on not letting my bare feet slip on the slick wet stones.  Once I left the fountain, at the other side, the Sun mocked me.  Clouds covered her, and the wind blew harder.  I was freezing, but it was one of the funnest things I did all weekend.  My only regret was wearing my thin white pants, which immediately became see-through when they were soaking wet.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>A little boy was having a wonderful time at the fountain today.  He borrowed one of our little squirt guns and uselessly squirted our wet shirts.  He called Neal 'big boy.'  We all laughed and shivered in the Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I need to realize that a lot of things are just like running through the liberal arts fountain at Purdue University.  I may be somewhat scared about what state I am in afterwords, but once I take that first step I will just forget them all.  A lot of things are just like that.  I am thinking about those things tonight, like writing a huge research paper, approaching and talking to the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, kissing said gorgeous girl.  I can&#039;t help but think about how much better I am as a person since I experienced the fountain run.  I can&#039;t help but wonder how my life would be different if I had just talked to that girl.  Life is full of little changes, little opportunities, and little jobs.  Some of them leave you dripping and shivering.  Some of them leave you with an awesome new knickname and a great post for your web log.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Siobhan, listen:  This is a message from yourself.  Never miss an opportunity again.  Never again.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

Our first interesting sight was a legion of stormtroopers taking a group photo on the steps of the capital builoding.  There were so many troopers that they needed to be in two equal size groups to fit on the steps.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>11:35 AM - We get in line, well, we start walking along the line to find the end.  TWO MILES LATER, we get to the end, and prepare for a short wait.  The people said that they would open the doors for us at 12:00.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>12:00 PM - The line slowly starts moving.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>1:30 PM - I call Fred.  FROM THE LINE.  Yes, still waiting.  At least it&#039;s moving pretty stedily now.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>2:00 PM - Finally, we get in.  The doors were just open, so there is no clear explanation why the line took so long.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>3:00 PM - We get nasty 6 dollar pizzas for lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>3:46 PM - I see my 300,000<sup>th</sup> nerd of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>4:00 PM - My dad arrives.  finally</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>4:30 PM - My Dad beats me at the demo game of the Star Wars Trading Card game (lousy game).</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>5:00 PM - I buy a new Star Wars lego set.  It r0xx0rz.  My dad also has to leave at this point, because he is due for a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>5:10 PM - I find the Decipher card game booth.  CHEAP OLD CARDS.  w007.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>5:15 PM - The cheap cards postponed to tomorrow, I start building the lego set.  I am supposed to meet my Mom at 6:00.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>6:30 PM - I finish the lego set.  One piece missing, a 2x1x1 red plate.  Damn.  Wait, it&#039;s 6:30.  Uh, oh.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>6:55 PM - Mom finally finds me, I was trying to make myself easy to find, it&#039;s not hard to spot the only 6&#039;8' guy.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>6:56 PM - Mom buys a Neimoidian mask.  We&#039;ll see how that goes tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>7:15 PM - We check out the Lucas Archives.  The first actual cool thing I see all day.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>7:30 PM - Mom and I go to the point where we are supposed to meet my Dad, who should be arriving again soon . . . </p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>8:30 PM - Where&#039;s Dad?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>8:45 PM - Ok, we use a payphone to call Dad, and he is going to pick us up in the front of the convention center.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>8:47 PM - On the way to the car, we se Warwick Davis!  He is awesome, and the biggest celebrity I see all day.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>9:00 PM - When we stop at Taco Bell, I almost get beaten up by a big black guy who thought I took his drink.  WTF?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>9:30 PM - Home, to sort through my cards to see what I need to buy tomorrow.  Am I the only person who likes the Jedi Knights game from Decipher?

      "text": "<p>Update: Star Wars Celebration 3<p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Click here</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Yeah, ok, so that promise of an update every day was pretty dumb.  I got back really late Friday night, and I knew at that point that I wouldn&#039;t be able to post anything else all weekend.  So I&#039;ll talk about the whole thing right now!</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>In the last four days, I&#039;ve seen every single variation of 'trooper' imaginable.  Stormtroopers, Scout troopers, Clonetroopers, Commando Troopers, Imperial Guard troopers, Snow troopers, Imperial Pilots, Imperial Officers, FAT stormtroopers, FAT pilots, the Elvis stormtrooper (yes), the construction worker stormtrooper, Rebel troopers, rebel pilots, etc, etc, etc.  It&#039;s the fat ones that crack me up.  Sombody dropped a little ice cream in their clone vats, I guess.  I saw a couple Darth Vaders.  I saw a couple Hans, Lukes, Leias, Chewies, Landos, Ewoks, Yodas, even a couple <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/generalgrievous/' title='Check him out'>General Grievouses</a>.  A bunch of people dressed up for this thing.  My sister got a picture of a table near the food court.  Sitting at the table were two Han Solos, Two Luke Skywalkers, a Leia in a gold bikini, and a Wookie with his head sitting on the table.  I will try to get the picture up here in the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>At least 100,000 people were there over the 4 day event.  You honestly could not go anywhere where you would be more than 2 feet from someone else.  Lines stretched around the building.  The wait for the celebration store (where you could purchase the special Celebration 3 Darth Vader action figure, plus a bunch of clothes) was 7 hours long at one point.  To see any of the shows or talks, you had to get in line at least a half an hour before the thing started, and walk for a while to find where the line ends.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>The different talks were pretty awesome.  On Friday, <b title='My Mom and Dad, My Sister, and Myself'>we</b> saw Ray Park (Darth Maul), and he wowed us with his martial arts.  Later on Friday, we went to the 'Rick McCallum Spectacular' which was spectacular (hold on a sec).  Then on Saturday, we just made it to see George Lucas himself.  It was one of the coolest moments of my life, because Master Lucas is something of an Idol to me.  I could go on and on about how great he is, but that&#039;s another story.  George explained why the prequels are so different from the originals, and he talked about his plans for a live action Star Wars television show.  Seeing him made the whole thing worth it, for me anyway.  Later in the day, after we watched the 'spectacular' again, we saw Warwick Davis (Wickett the Ewok, various other small characters).  Warwick was totally awesome, and he had a lot of great stories about his carreer, and indeed his resume is nothing to scoff at.  Later in the night, my Sister and I saw John Knoll&#039;s presentation on the special effects of the whole series.  It was a really interesting presentation.  On Sunday, we saw Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and he is 7&#039;4' which is really cool for me.  I don&#039;t usually get to see people that are taller than I am.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Now then, about that Rick McCallum Spectacular.  It was a 10 minute reel of clips from Episode 3, with another 10 minute reel of ILM special effect breakdowns from the movie.  The first video is without a doubt the coolest thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  The special effects look absolutely outstanding.  I cannot wait to see this movie.  I still have the wonderful music from the video stuck in my head.  It was just something they dug up to put on it, but it really worked well.  After the 10 minute clip, they showed a clip with a bunch of ILM special effects from the movie.  It was pretty cool, too.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>I could go on and on, but I&#039;ll stop here.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>I&#039;m going to start a countdown to the movie, so that I can tell how long I have to wait.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>Ok, I&#039;m sorry for not posting anything in a while, I&#039;ve had a lot of stuff to say but I&#039;ve been either too lazy or too busy to post.<p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Click here to get the skinny on everything.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>It started two weeks ago.  We had to take out lofts down and turn them in on Thursday, April 28.  That was a big hassle, because we had (and by 'we' I mean 'I') had to totally rearrange the room so that we could return our beds to the lofted position. Everything I moved just uncovered more piles of various filth. Huge piles of dust, piles of socks, piles of other random stuff. It was pretty disgusting, especially since most of it wasn&#039;t mine, and most especially because every pile had various foods and liquids in them. Chris Fancher and I played a small soccer match in the hall with an old piece of cheese stick that I found under Scott&#039;s desk. The cheesestick looked completely fine, but since it had been sitting under some socks for a couple weeks, it had gotten extremely hard. It was so hard that it hurt my toe when I kicked it without a shoe on. It skidded down the hall and pinged against the wall with a hard knock. We said a lot of words expressing our disgust at that.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Anyway, I was able to get the room resituated, and with the help of most of the guys in the hall, we lofted the beds. Mission accomplished. We didn&#039;t have much time to relax, however, because we had finals that next week, and then we had to move out. I was scared about moving out, to be sure. Here are some pictures of the task that befell us: </p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n<a href='../assets/images/room.jpg' title='I spy a bottle of water.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/roomthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\r\n<a href='../assets/images/window.jpg' title='I spy Winnie the Pooh.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/windowthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\r\n<a href='../assets/images/mycloset.jpg' title='I spy an Elephant.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/myclosetthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href='../assets/images/scottcloset.jpg' title='I spy some extremely old donuts.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/scottclosetthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<a href='../assets/images/mydesk.jpg' title='I spy disk 1.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/mydeskthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\r\n<a href='../assets/images/scottsdesk.jpg' title='I spy a white electrical plug.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/scottsdeskthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>We had a lot of work ahead of us, as you can see. Everything went well, though, and we were able to entertain the hall while we did it. They were all really eager to see how we would get all of that junk out of the room, but they weren&#039;t quick to help. The only help we got from them was Fred, and he only helped by taking a bunch of stuff that we didn&#039;t really want anymore. He took a pack of plastic spoons and plastic forks, some oatmeal creme pies, a half full bag of wal-mart brand cereal, a broken lavalamp, an old ethernet patch cable, and a bunch of other junk. See if you can find any of that in the pictures! (some of it cannot be seen).</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Here it is, a whole week later, and I still haven&#039;t unpacked yet, so my room at home is just about as cluttered. Oh well, I&#039;m used to it, right?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Right?</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>My plan was just to work all summer, and make a bunch of money to buy some stuff for the room and have money to use at school next year. I was totally expecting, except for the movie coming out in a week, to have a really boring summer. However, I&#039;ve only been home a week and it&#039;s already shaping up to be one of the best summers ever. My parents gave me my birthday present early this year. Yeah, my birthday is also May 19 (Mr. Lucas must have known, so he decided to give me a present. What a nice guy!). So what did I get for my 19th birthday? Well, since you are impatient you&#039;ve probably already clicked the link below and found out for yourself. Yes, my parents gave me a Darth Vader costume for my 19th birthday. </p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/jumpsuit.jpg' title='He&#039;s not so scary with just the jumpsuit on.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/jumpsuitthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/jumpsuit2.jpg' title='He&#039;s not so scary with just the jumpsuit on.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/jumpsuit2thumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/jumpsuit3.jpg' title='He&#039;s not so scary with just the jumpsuit on.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/jumpsuit3thumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/jumpsuit4.jpg' title='He&#039;s not so scary with just the jumpsuit on.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/jumpsuit4thumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/maskoff.jpg' title='I fill it out, don&#039;t I?'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/maskoffthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/sidevader.jpg' title='What a dork.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/sidevaderthumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/chokeaili.jpg' title='Episode 3 Spoiler.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/chokeailithumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/jointhedarkside.jpg' title='Join me and we can rule the galaxy.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/jointhedarksidethumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\t\t\t<a href='../assets/images/vader/family.jpg' title='I&#039;m not wearing any shoes. I&#039;m tall.'><img src='../assets/images/thumbs/familythumb.jpg' ></a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Yeah, how nerdy is that? It&#039;s pretty nerdy, really. If you ask me, anyway. Pretty damn nerdy. Well, anyway, that&#039;s a pretty cool thing. I just might be one of the only 19 year old boys who would be excited to get a Darth Vader costume for his birthday. I will be making various appearances across Greenfield, Indiana on the day of the movie, so that&#039;s going to be super fun.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>My parents just got a cable internet connection in early March, so for the first time ever, I have the internet in my bedroom. It&#039;s really surreal to think that I have the entire world at my fingertips right here. I&#039;ve never had that here before. I am typing this whole thing right in my bedroom. I&#039;ve never been this connected to my friends. I&#039;ve never had this many friends to talk to all at once, either. It&#039;s crazy for me. I thought this summer would be boring, but I&#039;m experiencing so many new things. Really wonderful things that have happened to me in the last couple weeks.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>It&#039;s surreal for me, too, to think that this could be the last time I will spend a prolonged time living with my parents. I could quite possibly have an internship in California next summer which would mean that I would have to move there. If anything, my parents are seriously looking at new property with the thought that they would be moving, which means that this will probably be the last time I will be living in the house that I have lived in my whole life. It feels like I&#039;m careening along a road, and the mountains I see just ahead of me are the many ways my life will soon change. The mountains aren&#039;t ahead of me, though. I&#039;m careening along a mountain road, with mountains all around me. I was talking to a friend the other day, and she told me that I have changed so much in the two months that she has known me. I think it&#039;s true. It&#039;s ok, though. I&#039;ve gotten used to mountain climbing. I&#039;ve gone on a hundred fountain runs since I&#039;ve been home. A hundred times, I&#039;ve climbed those mountains. That&#039;s just since I&#039;ve been home. I have so many mountains yet to climb, though.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I need to start saving my money, though. I want to purchase most of the following items before next year:</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Digital Camera</b> - I don&#039;t need a top of the line one, but 4 or 5 megapixels would be cool.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Cellular Telephone</b> - I still want one, although when I get one I&#039;ll probably almost never use it.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>High Definition Television</b> - This is for the room next year.  Just a basic one.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>New Personal Data Assistant</b> - Yeah, I&#039;m going to retire the ol&#039; Ipaq that my Dad gave me recently.  It doesn&#039;t give me the features that I really need (want).</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I&#039;ve been talking about it for some time.  I want a new website.  I need to redesign a new website.  It will happen, and it will happen soon, so don&#039;t worry. Here are some wicked cool features you can look forward too:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>PHP scripting</b> - Nobody knows what it really stands for, but it kicks ass, so I&#039;m using it.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>NO FRAMES</b> - Everyone hates frames, especially the web designers who have to wade through the billions of files that they create.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>Easy Comment system</b> - I don&#039;t think anyone has actually tried, but all over the site I have little comment links.  They don&#039;t work, in case you haven&#039;t noticed.  With PHP I can change that!</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>More symbols</b> - I will spam my symbol all over the place, even more than I already have!</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>No Splash page</b> - I&#039;m getting rid of the stupid page that just says 'ENTER' on it.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>Easier Navigation</b> - The menu will be easier to use, and I&#039;m turning the portfolio into a sepparate site.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>More stuff of the moment</b> - I&#039;ll have a whole slew of '*blank* of the moment' stuff.  Right now I just have a joke and a poem of the moment.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>Better look</b> - I&#039;m bored with my current look, and I hope you are too because it&#039;s changing.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>More pictures</b> - I&#039;ve tried to put as many pictures as I could into this site, but I&#039;m going to have even more once I have my own digital camera to take them with.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>Higher compatibility</b> - the new site will work equally perfect on any browser you view it with (provided it is up to date).  I still believe that Firefox is the <b>BEST</b> browser ever, but a lot of people use Internet Explorer too.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<li><b>And much much more!</b></li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>I created this site, as you may know, mostly as a way to stay in touch with my parents.  Since I am living with them now, I&#039;ve pretty much lost 90% of my audience.  I never really thought many people actually read what I put up here, and there was little proof to change my mind. However, if you Google 'Shauvon,' the first result you will get is this very site. I think that will get me a lot more traffic, so I need to have something worth looking at when they get here. (by the way, for those of you who actually know what I&#039;m talking about, the phrase 'super cramming power' is still NOT on google) So although I don&#039;t think I have any audience at all, I will still redesign the site. One, I need something to do and to think about. Two, I want to make my site better than <a href='http://www.ontariosuave.com' title='A very good site' class='black'>Cameron Marston</a>&#039;s. And C, I want to make things easier for me to update, so that I have to do less work. Keep in touch, and email me if you have any suggestions. (I only got one comment on the name of the site, from Cameron himself, and he told me to make it 'noteverystudent.com') My hopes are slim that I will get any suggestions, though.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>And now, the phrase everyone&#039;s been waiting for: </p>",

I don&#039;t take things as they come (when it really counts). I don&#039;t live life in the moment (absolutely never happens). I don&#039;t love life.  I don&#039;t breath in every breath with joy.  I don&#039;t live like a blade of grass in the wind.  I spent all freakin&#039; weekend working on my new website (honestly 8 AM to 11 PM four days in a row), instead of out there enjoying the beautiful day like I should have been.  I hate this.  I&#039;m living everything but now.  I wish I could go back and change everything, and I am making up rediculous fantasies for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It turns out I din&#039;t really change.  I never do, really.  I say I do, and I act all high and mighty for a couple days, but then I&#039;m right back to the stupid, selfish, obnoxious, unhygienic nerd that is Shauvon McGill (spelled correctly).  I am not, nor will I ever be truly happy.  I will never run out of things to want.  I read that ATI is coming out with a product to compete with nVidia&#039;s SLI technology.  I&#039;m going to have to get me one of those babies.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The fact of the matter is that I&#039;m not attractive, I&#039;m not healthy, and I&#039;m not very fun when you get right down to it.  That&#039;s the truth, told by the only person who really knows me more than anyone else.  <i>Oh, no, you&#039;re just being hard on yourself!</i> I hear everyone saying.  It&#039;s not true.  as much as people can tell me how great I am, I still know the truth, and that is what I have to live with.  I hate that people are starting to tell me that I&#039;m a good person, because this whole facad that I put up is all a lie.  I feel like it is, anyway.  I don&#039;t do anything by nature.  I&#039;m never just 'myself.'  blah blah blah blah . . . <i>nobody&#039;s really paying any attention anyway, and my wrists are tired.</i></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Screwed up Carpal Tunnels at age 19.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Scott came by today.  He told me far more than I wanted to know about <i>episode 3</i>.  I wanted to ignore it and just take the movie for what it is, but I can tell that it will be a dissappointment.  Even for me, it&#039;s going to be a dissappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Whenever I get an opinion for myself, it always ends up being wrong.</b></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I had my second day in the office today.  I work for my Dad, if anyone cares.  I just do odd jobs for him.  He&#039;s an architect, a partner at a small firm in Noblesville.  They pride themselves on being the best firm in Noblesville (there are a suprising ammount of architects in the rather small city).  I don&#039;t know what they did without me, because I&#039;ve been here two days and I&#039;ve already fixed a whole bunch of problems.  I never feel like I work hard enough there.  I&#039;m always slacking off, just trying to make that clock hit 5 any way I can.  My dad always tells me that I&#039;m the best thing since the &#039;t&#039; square (not his words).  He always tells me how helpful I&#039;ve been and everything.  I can&#039;t help but think that it&#039;s just a dad throwing endless praise at his only son, trying to make him pull himself out of the hole he&#039;s dug for himself.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>My mom&#039;s incubating chicken eggs again.  They started hatching today.  A baby chicken is one of the smallest, most helpless creatures in the entire world.  I can&#039;t help but relate to and envy them.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I got my grades.  Three C&#039;s and two B&#039;s.  My GPA actually went <i>down</i> from a 2.6.  It&#039;s now 2.4, and although I tell everyone that I don&#039;t care as long as I pass, it&#039;s all lies.  I hate myself for doing this.  I hate myself for sleeping in instead of going to class.  I hate myself for not paying attention to important details.  I hate myself for not doing really easy things that would have raised my grade considerably.  I feel so terrible every single time I even think negative things toward Scott.  I&#039;m 'doin&#039; fine' with my lousy 2.4, and Scott&#039;s annoyed that his grade dropped to a 3.9.  My 'competition' Cameron Marston got close to a 4.0, too (that&#039;s four - oh as well, not 402).  I hate how much of a terrible student I am.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I scared the crap out of Scott&#039;s mom the other day when I went to visit in my Vader costume.  That makes me smile.  That&#039;s also kinda&#039; depressing.  That&#039;s what I&#039;ve become?  I go around visiting my friends in a $700 costume from a science fiction movie.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I will never fine the love that I&#039;m so desperately searching for.  I always try to pick the damn apples before they&#039;re ripe.  I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the right analogy, but I&#039;m tired and I&#039;m sick of my pretentious 'style' of writing, which is just coming up with the first cheesy metaphore that pops into my head.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I ate lunch at my spot today.  It&#039;s a place down on the white river just down the road and through a private property from the office I work at.  It&#039;s so peaceful there, so relaxing, but all I could think about was how much I wished that somebody, anybody, was there with me.  All I did was just make up conversations I would have with them if they were there.  That&#039;s all I ever do.  Just next to my spot is this beautiful grass field, with light glinting off of the grass like something so much more valuable than gold.  I wanted to just run off into that field, past the 'no tresspassing' sign, past the fence, past the line of trees on the far side.  I wanted to feel the grass under my feet, feel the world leave me as I left it behind.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I might just run off into that field tomorrow.  I might just run off and never come back.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Jesus Christ, that&#039;s depressing.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I&#039;m going to get some sleep and try to make sense of all this.  Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not running away (I think).</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>. . . . . . wow. . . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I just blinked for the first time since midnight last night.  Holy crap, I don&#039;t know where to begin.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It was absolutely wonderful.  Just wonderful.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is a douche bag and a moron.  I would love to write a full review or whatever, but that&#039;s just annoying.  I&#039;ll sum up my major points in a second.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I stood in line for 5 hours with a Darth Vader costume on.  Just to show the level of energy in the huge line of nerds, when I stepped out of the car, and started walking towards the croud, they slowly started clapping and cheering at me.  Everyone wanted their picture taken with me choking them.  A couple girls wanted a hug from Darth Vader (weird, but whatever).  It was just so cool to feel so welcome.  I had such power.  I could walk up to any of these die hard fans and hold my hand up, and they would immediately fall to the ground like I was force-choking them.  It was awexome fun.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ok, so here are my points about the movie:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul><li>The mood of the film was so incredible.  Just to prove how amazing it was, the theatre was FULL of roudy nerds who were full of caffein and excitement, but as soon as the movie started, the house was absolutely silent the ENTIRE time.  It was that powerful</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>The special effects were phenomenal.  I don&#039;t think that anyone has 'sold out' in any of the prequels by using cutting edge special effects.  I don&#039;t understand why anyone would say that.  The fact of the matter is that if this movie doesn&#039;t win an oscar for special effects, I lose what little faith I have left in Hollywood.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>The acting was the best ever.  This is the first Star Wars movie that didn&#039;t have any flaws in the major roles at all.  Ewan McGreggor is so superbly perfect as Obi Wan, Natalie Portman is fantastic, and Hayden Christensen was even better than last time (YES I THINK HE IS A GOOD ACTOR DAMMIT).  The most amazing role, however, was Palpatine, played by Ian McDiarmid.  Every nuance of Palpatine&#039;s character was flawless.  If McDiarmid doesn&#039;t win an oscar for his performance, I&#039;ll lose what little faith I have left in Hollywood.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Editing, Writing, Camera work, Story, all fabulous; if this movie doesn&#039;t get oscars for everyting possible, I will lose what little faith I have left in Hollywood.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>My only complaint.  My ONLY complaint was the music.  It felt like just a remix of all the other soundtracks.  It didn&#039;t match the mood of the movie very well at all, and I realize now that the music was not very good in any of the prequels.  I blame all complaints and dissappointments in the prequels on the lousy music.  This movie does not deserve an oscar for the music.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Seriously.  Return of the King won every oscar imaginable, so it&#039;s Star Wars&#039;s turn.  Lucas has been cheated every single time by that stupid academy, and he damn well deserves some serious credit in my opinion.  Whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Point:</b>  See the movie, love the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Additional:</b>  If you haven&#039;t seen any Star Wars movies, DO NOT WATCH EPISODE 3 UNTIL YOU WATCH THE OTHERS.  At least the prequels.  It&#039;s so dark and depressing, it&#039;s not a good way to start the series, but it&#039;s the perfect way to . . . um . . . be in the middle of it.  E3 was the first of the films rated PG-13 for massive violence and strong themes and whatnot.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

For now, though, let me tell everyone what I want.  Consider it a late birthday present (not that anyone could actually make it happen).</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The phone rings.  I expect it to be for anyone but me.  The soft voice in the phone is full of a quiet youthfulness.  Very childlike, yet mysteriously mature, her voice is a window into the mysteries of her personality.  Somehow naive and wise at the same time, she has always been an enigma to me.  My raised eyebrows express my surprise that her particular voice is coming out of the phone.  I have never had many girls call me, almost completely never for just a friendly social call.  She has never called me before, and sometimes I feel like I am not wanted when I call her, so this turn of events is only adding to her riddle.  I have a hard time masking my excitement, but it is necessary not to seem too eager to hear from her.  What she says next is even more surprising.  'Shauvon,' she says, 'it&#039;s a beautiful day, do you want to go for a walk?'</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>'Sure,' as if there is any other possible answer.  Not a single event could prevent me from saying yes to her.  Part of her allure is that deep inside her is a person of calm maturity, but on the outside, that person is wrapped up in layers of fragile innocence.  Every time she speaks I feel the need to unravel her personality and find out just which of those traits, if either, is really her.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I love talking to her.  I feel like we could just talk for hours and hours.  The thought that she might feel the same way gives me renewed excitement.  However, I have to control myself.  I have to stay cool so that I don&acirc;€™t mess anything up.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>She arrives at my house, and she is just as beautiful as I have ever imagined a goddess to be.  Mysterious and powerful and strong, her mood expresses all of these.  She always has a look of innocence, though.  Millions of thoughts race through my mind as she walks toward me.  She just stands there smiling -- up at me, of course -- waiting for me to make my move.  When I hug her she just seems to fit in my arms.  A certain hollow part of me is completed when I have my arms around her.  She always hugs me very firmly, like she is afraid to lose me again.  What with college and everything, until a few weeks ago we hadn&acirc;€™t seen each other in a long time.  I think we both felt a loss, if only subconsciously.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We walk in each other&acirc;€™s arms.  She rests her head against my shoulder.  She caresses my arm with her fingers.  I always feel safe in her arms, safe from doubt.  I always feel like she knows what she is doing.  I could fall in love with her fingers, lightly running along my arm.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>She just wants to be friends and have fun.  She doesn&acirc;€™t want to take this anywhere, yet she caresses my arm with such care.  She looks up at me with those innocent pleading eyes, waiting for me to kiss her.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We end up just lying in a grass field, pondering the future.  I know I need to tell her how exactly I feel about her.  I have said that all I want is to be friends, yet I know that isn&acirc;€™t true.  I feel myself falling in love with her mystery and innocent charm.  I am falling in love with her cute voice, and her gorgeous body.  I should tell her, yet the words never form in my head.  When I start to think that I will lose my chance, she says it for me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>She looks into my eyes, into my soul, with those huge eyes.  She removes her innocent self for just a moment to expose her much more mature and wise self, and she tells me the very words that I was worried about telling her.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>'I might be falling in love with you,' is all she says.  It is all she needs to say.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>My raised eyebrows express my surprise to hear her say that.  I am no longer frozen by the fear of ruining things.  I see things clearer than I ever have.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We spend the afternoon in each other&acirc;€™s arms, in a field of grass, under the watchful gaze of the sun, in the arm of a unfathomable galaxy, hurtling through space in an infinite universe.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Love- a finite reaction to an infinite universe</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Love- an infinite passion for a finite being</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Love- an enigma</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

Gee, <b>thanks a lot</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>This really bums me out on many levels, and I&#039;m losing my hope that this year will be <b>pleasant at all</b>.  Cameron and his <b>Hate All Things Everywhere<sup>tm</sup></b> club is, as you might guess, very negative toward everything.  To him, verything is just a <b>bother</b>, set to <b>impede him</b> every step of the way.

I&#039;ll admit that it has its down sides.  The food wasn&#039;t perfect, there were a lot of drunk people doing very stupid things at 2 in the morning, there was a lot of noise, we did have to put up with all of the stupid rules, etc., etc.  There are good things, though, too, and HATE doesn&#039;t seem to recognize the other side of <b>any argument</b>.  The president of HATE, Mr. HATE if you will, will probably send me a scathing email about how <b>wrong I am</b> and how much his hatred for all things is, in fact, <b>somehow healthy</b>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Alow me to drop the <b>charade</b> (pronounce that &#039;sha-raad,&#039; like a pretentious prick would).  What place do I have to complain about Cameron complaining, when I am guilty of the very thing that I am tearing him down for (rephrase that into something that makes more sense, unlike what a pretentious prick would do).  Maybe HATE isn&#039;t such a bad thing.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>But it does really bum me out, because I really thought that this would be a great year, with everyone hanging out in our room, and <b title='The Hutt'>Kevin</b> out of our lives.  Since Chris is bailing, though, that dream is shattered.  Chris just decides that he doesn&#039;t want to live with us anymore, and he says, 'Hooray for no more Dorm Life,' and I have to sit here and wonder if perhaps I should go on with the plan.  Here is what Chris is basically saying to Barry and me:  'Well, I don&#039;t want to live there because dorm life sucks, and I don&#039;t want to live with you guys, but I wish the best of luck to you two, and I hope you can stand it enough to make it through the year.'  I know his intentions are much better, but some of the worst things ever were done with good intentions.  What if I now decided that I didn&#039;t want to live in the room, either?  <b>What would Barry do, then?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Nothing is as bad as it seems.  Nothing ever is.  However, this is pretty bad, so it has a lot of leeway.  I&#039;m no longer excited about going back to school.  I am not going to work as much as I originally planned, because this will probably be the last summer I get, and things could go <b>downhill fast</b> come August.  I&#039;m going to take some time off and spend it with friends who don&#039;t just go back on promises.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well, I have a long day of work ahead of me, so I need to get to that.

Shauvon McGill has been working at Peterson Architecture for almost five weeks.  Actually, to be precise, he&#039;s been working for four years, plus five weeks.  This was his summer job through high school, and now he has returned the summer after his freshman year of college.  His father is a partner, and that is how he got the job.  Darren Peterson founded the company almost 10 years ago.  Now, Peterson Architecture has 7 employees, including Shauvon.  He does odd jobs for the employees; he does various tasks that bore the rest of them.  When someone says, 'if someone could make some plot files of this project . . . ' it means 'Shauvon, make some plot files of this project.'  He also replaces the tank on the water cooler.  On this website, Shauvon will tell stories about his continuing attempts to restore peace and justice to the galaxy . . .</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>We had this office meeting today, which we have every Monday, just to sort out the projects and various duties among the employees.  A main topic of today&#039;s meeting was introducing the new intern.  Yes, they hired a new intern, in addition to myself.  It was extremely sudden, and I wouldn&#039;t even know about it until today, if my Boss/Dad hadn&#039;t made an off hand comment about her on Wednesday last week.  I spent Thursday and Friday building a computer for her to use.  She is as old as I am, and she is going to Ball State Architecture school.  Apparently, having a car and a vagina makes her incredibly more useful to the office than I could ever be.  The office&#039;s Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch was very excited to hear that new intern had a car, and that the women outnumbered the men in the office.  Incidentally, Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch threw a party last year for her son, who was going off to kill iraqi children (he joined the marines).  The party involved a lot of high school students and a lot of alcohol.  She subsequently spent several weekends in prison.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I was supposed to get a bunch of new work to do for the week at this meeting.  All they told me to do was help another person with 'red lines.'  I don&#039;t know what 'red lines' are, so this should be interesting.  On a bit of a side note, I found out today that my Boss/Dad convinced a Darren to give me a two dollar raise, so now I&#039;m making $9 an hour.  I don&#039;t really care what job they have me doing, because I&#039;m making plenty of money from it.  So everyone has their little tasks to do, and the meeting was wrapping up, when one of the people, in a tongue-in-cheek way, asked Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy what jobs she had to do this week.  Crazy replied, 'Oh, I just sit here and look pretty.'  <i>Your only task and you still find a way to fail miserably at it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>So this new intern, after an hour of work (well, an hour of being shown around), had a much larger and warmer reception than I have even after 4 summers here.  Forget the fact that I have increased office productivity several times over.  Forget the fact that my skills with 3d modeling and rendering could provide endless new possibilities for the firm.  Forget that I have saved the company thousands of dollars by fixing things that nobody else there could ever dream of fixing.  You can even forget the fact that I have a very high level of skill with all of the workings and procedures at the office.  Even if you forget all of that, I should get a small bit of respect for the fact that I have been here for four years.  Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch still looks at me with the annoyance that she had when I first started here.  Crazy had to point out several basics of the office procedure to not just New Intern, but also myself.  She had to explain to BOTH OF US that when we get a project, we shouldn&#039;t ask her any questions about it.  <i>Thanks, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll trust you to answer ANY question I will EVER have, including those about minor consumption.  While you&#039;re at it, why don&#039;t you explain how to refill the water cooler, since I seem to have also forgotten that since last August.</i>  Not only does New Intern get her own desk and computer (complete with the lamp and mousepad taken directly from MY DESK), but she also gets to claim the extra work area previously devoted to my computer building area.  She is supposedly some sort of expert architectural model builder, so that is what she will, I guess, be doing most of the time.  Nobody seems to understand that 3d models could do far more for them than traditional foam-core ones could.  I am working on an interesting graphics project right now, however, and I hope to get some images up for that soon.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The Office takes every opportunity to go out for a two hour lunch.  I find that to be rather cheap.  They drag me along, wasting two hours of my day.  Two hours for lunch is fine for a person paid on a set salary, but for a person payed by the hour, it becomes something of a teeth grinding annoyance.  Today&#039;s occasion was New Intern&#039;s first day.  Crazy decided that we should go to this Italian restaraunt just down the street in downtown Noblesville.  It was extremely fancy.  The waitress was pretty terrible, but this woman kept walking through who was very - um - attractive, with tight pants and a spaghetti-strap tank top, so that was pleasant, at least.  Most of the time, I was just sitting there with a fake smile, trying not to look like I didn&#039;t want to be there.  I was trying to remember my first day, but not much was coming to mind.  We didn&#039;t go out for lunch when I started.  Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch organizes most (all) of the two-hour lunches, and since she didn&#039;t (doesn&#039;t) like me, we have never gone to lunch on my account.  Crazy might actually be warming up to me, though, because she made at least some note of my birthday when we were on a two-hour lunch for someone&#039;s one-year anniversary.  At today&#039;s lunch, I was sitting next to New Intern.  It was one of those unfortunate situations where everyone was in front of me walking to the table, so I watched in some horror as each seat was taken up, like a horrible car accident in slow motion.  The only remaining seat was the one next to New Intern.  I sat, trying not to wince.  If I was farther away from her, I would more easily be able to ignore all of the attention that I never recieved.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Crazy Bitch asked New Intern question after question, because she is the one who 'asks the questions,' according to Crazy herself.  Here&#039;s the scoop on New Intern:  She is the daughter of one of the main civil engineers that Peterson Architecture works with (my Boss/Dad insists that her employment is therefore a mostly political move).  She finished her first year at Ball State, and will be going back next year (which makes her a Sophomore, I think).  She just got back from some sort of trip to Europe.  She spend a week in Rome, and a week in England. I&#039;m as jealous as you, surely.  I put a word in edgewise, saying, 'the Vatican City has the lowest divorce rate in the world, out of any city.'  She had to imediately point out how stupid I am, saying that it was actually the smallest country in the world, not a city.  <i>It&#039;s called Vatican CITY, not Vatican COUNTRY.  I guess I just don&#039;t get it, or something.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I almost ordered veal.  I didn&#039;t want to be one of those guys that eats veal.  I figure that my whole outlook on life would have to change if I started eating veal.  Plus I wasn&#039;t sure if it was socially acceptable to have veal for lunch.  The latest edition of the <i>Social Rulebook<sup>tm</sup></i> hasn&#039;t come yet, so I&#039;m not familiar with the current standards.  Mostly, I wanted the veal because it was the most expensive thing on the menu, and the Office was paying.  It was $20.  When the lousy waitress got my order, I wimped out and said, 'I&#039;ll have the chicken breast.'  The waitress didn&#039;t know exactly which of the items I wanted (there was only one chicken breast on the menu), so she made it clear that I didn&#039;t actually say the name of the item as it appears on the menu.  I didn&#039;t say the actual name of the thing because I don&#039;t exactly speak Italian, so I just said 'chicken breast' which was what it obviously meant in english.  After that extremely akward exchange was over, we waited for our food to arive.  It took a very long time.  Once it arrived, I finished it in about 5 minutes.  It was the smallest 'chicken breast' I&#039;ve ever had, especially for $10.  It was awesome, but very small.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Well, on the way back to the office, my Boss/Dad told me about my raise, and he said that New Intern was pretty hot.  <i>That wasn&#039;t akward at all.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Some other highlights from the day:</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I didn&#039;t eat the lunch my mom packed for me for the 5th time in a row.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I <i>almost</i> finished my 3d rendering.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch left at 3:48 today.  Apparently, that&#039;s quitting time in crazy land.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>On the way home, I told my Boss/Dad that I was calling her the Secretary/Receptionist/Crazy Bitch, and he said, 'Oooo, that might be overdoing it a bit.  You should probably just call her the Crazy Bitch.'</p>\r\n\t\t\t<br><p>Later, I&#039;ll tell you all about a Darren, the other guy in charge of Peterson Architecture.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "<p>I&#039;m starting to get a little worried about something.  I have noticed that most of the time, I am extremely tired.  Every day, since I get up at some ungodly hour (well, for a 19 year old college student, anyway) and go to work all day, and I come home just completely exhausted.  Then on the weekends, I still feel tired.  I am worrying because if this is how the rest of my life is going to be, it won&#039;t be very pleasant for me or the people around me.  A nasty thunderstorm moved through Indiana, and a tornado could have easily come through our area.  Part of me actually wanted a tornado to hit the house, just because it would force me to change my life in ways that I don&#039;t think I will be able to on my own.  I really think that I need a drastic restructuring, and I&#039;m certainly not going to just go out and do it.  Anyway, a tornado didn&#039;t come through, and the house is fine.  I still have this disturbing voice that wants something interesting to happen no matter what the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>A couple guys came over last night and we played various video games.  Through the course of the night, we drank almost an entire case of Bawls high caffeine drink.  I didn&#039;t get to bed till almost 5, and if that happens my brain refuses to grasp the concept of sleep.  I got two hours of sleep, and I woke up sick to my stomache with these extremely analytical thoughts racing through my head at a billion miles a second.  For some reason, when my sleep schedule gets messed up, my brain goes into extreme programming mode, and I have pseudo dreams in which I need to create some sub function that will make myself sleep for another hour.  It&#039;s extremely bizzare, and it happens far more often than I think is normal (frankly once is too many).  I finally realize that I don&#039;t need to execute <span style='font-family: courier new'>sleepforhour();</span>, but then I usually have one or two bars of a song stuck on an infinite loop in my head, and nothing I can do will stop it.  This morning I just went down stairs and watched 'Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends' for a while, humming a couple bars to one of the Black Eyed Peas&#039; new songs.  I also felt like crap all day.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Tomorrow is going to be really hard.  More on that tomorrow.  If only I could see a paticular person tomorrow night, it would make everything worth it.  Unfortunately, that person doesn&#039;t want anything to do with me.  It seems like nobody ever does.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "title": "Wonderful dream",
      "text": "<p>I had a wonderful dream last night.  It was one of those dreams that was so vivid and happy that when I realized that it was a dream, it was a huge let down. Here&#039;s a synopsis:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It started with me moving back to school.  I had this really sweet room up on the third floor.  The room was nothing like the actual Meredith rooms, but it still seemed realy familiar.  I think that my brain recycles sets from old dreams, because I&#039;m pretty sure that the dorm room area was in a previous dream.  The room was back in the corner, and it had a window that overlooked a huge forest.  This is a little strange, because there isn&#039;t a forest anywhere near the dorms at Purdue.  I don&#039;t really remember too much else about this part, except that I kept thinking how awesome the year was going to be.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Then things got interesting.  The second part of my dream took place at my parent&#039;s house.  I&#039;m not sure if I was living there, or if I was visiting, but Natalie Portman was definitely visiting, and she was definitely in love with me.  Scott was there, too, and he was playing computer games on my dad&#039;s computer in my room.  I was showing Natalie around the house (I think she was staying for a while.  How awesome is that??!!).  We went up to my room, and I calmly asked Scott to go somewhere else for a while.  He left, and Natalie and I had the room to ourselves.  The strange thing is that my dream didn&#039;t lead to where you might think a dream about Natalie Portman would lead.  She just layed down on my bed, and I showed her my Star Wars toys (looking back on that, I realize the irony and akwardness of showing all of my Star Wars toys to Natalie Portman).  She just layed there, and smiled at me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In the dream it was understood that she was Natalie Portman, but she was also a bit of a conglomeration of several girls that I have partially been involved with in my life.  I think my brain was just drawing from what little knowlege I had about love, and it tried to create what would be the perfect girl for me (mission accomplished).  It was understood that we would eventually be doing that which my dreams often lead to (I&#039;m a 19 year old guy, after all), but there was no hurry.  We just stayed there in love with each other.  Finally my mom knocked on the door (in my dream) and told me that I have to go help her feed the animals.  This is also strange, because I haven&#039;t helped her with the animals in more than a year.  I looked at Natalie, who smiled at me, and I asked if she wanted to see the animals.  She agreed, and went down stairs.  Then for some reason, I put on some really goofy clothes (the sad thing is that they were all clothes that I actually own) and went down to help my mom.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Natalie was sitting on the couch, and I walked down as goofy as I could (this is also very normal for me).  I was obviously showing off for her, and she just laughed and laughed.  My mom was telling me something about the animals (she is always telling me something about the animals, it seems) but I don&#039;t remember what it was.  All I remember is the feeling of being loved.  It showed me just how much I need that in my life right now.  It was so beautiful and so wonderful.  When I woke up (my brain automatically wakes up at 6:40 now) and I looked around, my room and bed was empty.  I would have given anything to be able to go back.  I wanted to go back to the dream, back to the love and the perfect girl.  I wanted to go back to thinking that this year will be awesome.  I wanted to go back to just being my goofy self, and finally being appreciated for it.  I couldn&#039;t, though.  I had to go into the world where nobody appreciates me.  I had to go into the world where every girl I am ever partially involved with doesn&#039;t want anything to do with me, where there is no perfect girl and there is no love.  I had to go into the world where no one smiles at me, and no one cares.  I had to go into the world where Natalie Portman doesn&#039;t even know I exist.  I had to wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Anyway, if anyone thinks they can shed some light on just what the hell any of that meant, I would love to hear from you.  Or if, by any chance, you know Natalie Portman, put in a good word for me.  Apparently my subconcious has a bit of a crush on her.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>So it has been 3 very Natalie Portman-less days since my last post.  Perhaps you guys didn&#039;t really understand me when I asked for you to put in a good word . . . </p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ok, I&#039;m really just joking, I guess.  I understand that I probably won&#039;t ever meet her.  I have a court order here that says that I won&#039;t meet Keira Knightley, either (I&#039;m kidding here, too).  I&#039;m going to confess.  I have 172 high-resolution pictures of Keira Knightley&#039;s various magazine photoshoots on my computer desktop.  In addition to that, I am in the process of adding about 100 more images of Natalie Portman.  There, now the world knows.  I have two monitors on my computer, see, so Natalie Portman appears on one, and Keira Knightley appears on the other.  All the images are at 1280x1024 pixels, and I developed a nice little javascript that randomly changes them every 2 minutes.  I am not ashamed of this little image gallery I have collected.  I know some people (well, I knew some people) who had hundreds of naked women that cycled on their desktop, and they didn&#039;t even know those women&#039;s names, so it could be worse.  All of my images are tasteful, and I learned a lot about how Windows works, javascript, and Adobe Photoshop while I was making them.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>To me, it&#039;s more than just looking at pretty women.  Sure, a big part of it IS just looking at pretty women.  The really important thing, though, is what they represent.  To me, those two women represent the most perfect example of what the human race is capable of.  Sometimes I lose faith in our species (that&#039;s suprising, isn&#039;t it?), but it gives me faith in the future when I see that such perfect beauty exists.  The universe is a very confusing place, and it is very hard to understand just what our purpose is.  That is why I have pictures of them on my desktop.  When I see those pictures, I have purpose.  I see our place in the universe.  I feel like we aren&#039;t here to create or conquer or forge our way, like most people think.  It seems to me like we exist to experience the culmination of some higher power.  I think that it is quite possible that something worked for millenia to create this place we live in, and we were simply created just to experience it.  We are art patrons, browsing the most complex art museum ever created: ourselves.  We train our telescopes on stellar constellations and beauties throughout the universe, and we write and draw and sculpt and express our interpretations of what we see.  We surround ourselves with beauty.  It&#039;s in our gardens, our films, our music, our clothes, our homes, our offices, our vehicles, our cities, our restaurants, our yards, our pets, our imaginations, and ourselves.  Sure, this theory might be a little hard to believe, but isn&#039;t it somewhat nicer than most of the other theories out there?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley are two of the most beautiful human beings who have ever lived, but they aren&#039;t alone.  They are only an example of the perfection that exists in this world.  People like them are everywhere; beauty as breathtaking as theirs is everywhere.  This art museum that we live in is filled to the absolute brim with further examples of what the universe is capable of.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Take a look around you.  Look at how much beauty is around you right now.  Wherever you are, it doesn&#039;t matter, there is something.  Even the monitor that you are looking at right now is a beautiful example of human perseverance and raw creativity.  Look around you every single moment you are alive and ask youself: <i>What is truly important in this world?</i> Look at the beauty that is all around you and ask youself that question.  If everyone would just take the time to do that, would the world be a better place?  If everyone would just take the time to stand back and admire this work of art, how would things be different?  It is very easy to forget.  I forget all the time (just look at most of my last 10 posts).  That is why I think about Keira and Natalie all the time.  It&#039;s not because I&#039;m obsessed, it&#039;s not because I&#039;m a stalker, and it&#039;s not because I&#039;m in love with them.  I have those pictures of them because I am human, I am alive, and they make my life have purpose.  My life is worth living simply because I am able to appreciate the absolute beauty in people like Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman.  They make my life worth living.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>So if either of those women ever read this, even if it is in 30 years and everything else is forgotten, I want to thank them.  <i>Thank you Natalie, thank you Keira.  Thank you for existing.  Thank you for contributing to this cosmic art show.  Even if you don&#039;t know who I am, you don&#039;t understand, this creeps you out, or you just don&#039;t care, thank you anyway.  I speak not for myself, but for the entire universe when I say that.  This is a much better place to live thanks to you.</i></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I still would like to meet them some day, just to see what they&#039;re like.  I want to meet them just to see if they are really as beautiful as they appear.  A beautiful face is one thing, but it pales in comparison to the beauty and nuance of the human <i>soul</i>.  That&#039;s one thing that a computer desktop can&#039;t randomly cycle every two minutes.  It&#039;s also why a lot of people I know are every bit as beautiful as they are.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>Here are a couple quick updates.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Click here</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I had the day off yesterday, and instead of working on a website (my mom is hiring me to create a website for her book), I played video games.  I purchased a copy of <i>Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault</i> over the weekend, so I spent most of yesterday killing very evil enemy soldiers (I can&#039;t think of a way to say 'killing Japanese people' at all politically correct).  It&#039;s a fun game, and not near as hard as <i>Brothers in Arms</i>, even at the harder dificulty levels.  Scott came over in the afternoon, and we spent a couple hours dealing with computer crashes and Random Infuriating Malfunctions that are as unexplainable as they are impossible to fix.  Out of the entire afternoon, we were only able to play most of one semi-decent round of Unreal Tournament before we had to eat dinner.  I love computers so much, don&#039;t you?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>I&#039;ve been thinking a lot about the movie <i>Casablanca</i> with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  It&#039;s about a guy (Bogart) who owns a nightclub in Nazi Occupied Africa.  This woman shows up (Bergman), and it turns out that Bogart&#039;s character was once in love with her, and she walked out on him, thus breaking his heart.  Of course, he&#039;s too much of a &#039;man&#039; to really admit that she broke his heart, but the idea is there.  Through the course of the movie, she explains why she did it, and they both decide that they still love each other.  Of course it&#039;s not that easy.  One of the reasons that this is one of the most popular movies of all time is that it is more realistic about love than most movies are.  Life always looks so bright, but then it always has a catch.  Here&#039;s the catch:  Bergman&#039;s character happens to be traveling to Casablanca with one of the leaders of the french resistance, who happens to be her husband.  The love between the two main characters is rekindled, only to be torn apart again at the end.  I&#039;m going to give away the end of the story because if you haven&#039;t seen the movie yet, you probably don&#039;t care.  Bergman ends up leaving on a plane, and Bogart immortalizes several phrases, such as, 'Here&#039;s lookin&#039; at you, kid,' and 'this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.'</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>The fact of the matter is that, subtracting the male bravado of the period, that is how life realy is.  I can&#039;t really think of a way to explain this without sounding like the most depressing person in the world.  I am aware that this is extremely depressing, so I don&#039;t need everyone telling me that.  I&#039;m not depressed, per se, I&#039;m just confused.  Life seems to be teaching me that our hearts (that&#039;s the metaphysical concept of our expression and feelings of love, not the actual physical device through which blood is pumped into our bodies) are only here to be broken.  I have firm evidence to back this up, but I&#039;m not going to cite it.  I&#039;m sticking with a scientific approach.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>It is emergent in evolution that for a species to most successfully survive, it will develop a concept of selective breeding.  Humans are successful because they feel that certain members of the species are more worthy than others, in a subconcious attempt to select the best genes for reproduction.  This trait can be seen in most other animal species.  All animals are instictively compelled to prove their capabilities to prospective mates.  Those animals are instinctively finding and promoting the best and most evolutionarily acceptible traits to make sure that their species will continue to prosper.  Humans do the very same thing.  Since humans are supposedly intelligent creatures, they have to find a logical explanation for why they are compelled to behave this way.  We call it love.  It has nothing to do with fate, religion, or astrology.  We are simply acting on instinct.  It makes sense, then, that we will be instinctively attracted to the most acceptable mates, even those that we could never possibly ever even meet or have a future with.  What if that 'warm, fuzzy feeling' was just a series of evolved chemical reactions developed by our brains to reward us for finding an acceptable proponent of the species?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>I&#039;m just thinking out loud here.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>In a similar topic, I heard this morning that scientists are trying to develop an artificial heart that would function inside a human who&#039;s original heart had failed them.  They are running into a lot of problems getting it to work (naturally), and are only able to keep patients alive for a couple months with the lead ticker.  I&#039;m not even going to write a quirky, thought provoking comment about this, the possibilities are just too numerous.  I can&#039;t pick one.  I&#039;ll just say that humans have artificial hair, artificial cotton, artificial grass, artificial rubber, artificial sugar, etc, etc, etc.  However, they can&#039;t seem to create a functioning artificial heart.  That can be said whether you are talking about the real, or the metaphysical.  Feel free to come up with whatever clever comment you want about that.<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Once again, I find myself lost.  I had a bit of a grip on my life for a while there, but I&#039;ve lost that once again.  I am never really sure what I&#039;m doing.  At best I can only manage to ignore the fact that I have no direction at all.  I need to just relax and embrace the fact that I don&#039;t have to have a direction.  This is college life, just wandering around bumping into things until something sticks.  I can&#039;t stand not knowing where I&#039;m going, though.  I have always had things planned out to a T, with goals specifically mapped out.  Now I don&#039;t know what goals to make.  The real irony is that I wanted to be like this.  When I was thinking about college a year or two ago, I wanted to feel the transient, nomad sort of life.  Like every other decision I have ever made, I really regret that.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Last night, when I was appologizing to someone for one of the many things that I have regretted over the last couple years, they told me something that really interested me.  Of course, everything that paticular person says interests me (she is indeed a very acceptable member of our species, as my instincts tell me), but this really echoed in my brain.  <i>People shouldn&#039;t regret anything</i>, she said, <i>especially for the rest of their life</i>.  I wonder.  I wonder what that would be like, or if it&#039;s even possible for me at this point.</p>",

I am confused, however, that the shadow on the fist suggests that the light source is coming from directly in front (ie, coming from us), but the fire behind the fist seems to be the only light source there.  Maybe the happy gentleman is casting light.  That might be what those psychodelic outlines would be representing.  I feel sorry for the little unicorn.  He is saying, 'Aw Shucks!'  Perhaps he feels that the much larger, freely advertising unicorn is stealing all of his thunder (represented, maybe, by the 'zoom!' lightning).  Perhaps he is worried about our little sheep friend.  I would be worried about her, too.  The poor sheep seems to have some idea that something is up, but she can&#039;t quite think of what exactly it is.  The fire says 'BFF'.  I can guess what that stands for, but with those &#039;f&#039;s, everything I come up with would just end up having the word &#039;fuck&#039; in it.  &#039;Big Fucking Fire&#039; immediately comes to mind.  One gets the impression that the &#039;zoom!&#039; lightning bolt is coming from either the sheep (which might explain why someone would want to shoot it), or the large unicorn&#039;s eye.  I think the large unicorn is mad at the corn, which is infested with shuriken flowers and mind-controlling snails who 'Do what want!!'  So the unicorn is using his laser vision to destroy the farmer&#039;s corn (much to the shock of the smaller unicorn).  Currently the corn farmer is distracted by his sheep, who escaped to eat the strange grass that seems to be growing on the unicorn&#039;s face.  Meanwhile, the happy glowing hobo with giant hands has a chick skewered on his hobo stick, and is really enjoying shaking what looks like hair out of the poor thing into the Big Fucking Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>'Cheep', says the chick.  Cheep, indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>The artist was Melissa Smith, and she can be reached at smith261@purdue.edu.

      "text": "\t\t\t\t<p>Here&#039;s something I don&#039;t get.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>There is a roll of paper towels in the bathroom where I work.  Presumably, it is for drying your hands.  The strange thing about this roll of paper towels is that they are printed with nice little images of various herbs and spices.  Yes, the paper towels have cute images of Sage, Cinnamon, and Thyme.  When someone is wiping up a spill, or drying off their hands, do they often want to study up on their various herbs and spices?  I know that I sometimes wonder what a cinnamon plant looks like, but I&#039;ve never really been interested enough to want it printed on my paper towels.  Sometimes I forget what rosemary looks like, but I have never needed to remember when I was drying my hands in the bathroom.  I guess I can&#039;t really know what&#039;s going through the average homemaker&#039;s mind.  It is possible that somewhere a soccer mom is a better cook because she was able to study the differences between a stalk of rosemary and a cinnamon plant while she was wiping the spilled baby formula off of the counter top.  It might be possible that somewhere in this societal black hole of a country there is a person who&#039;s life was saved when someone threatened to kill them if they didn&#039;t properly identify a specific herb. <i>Oh, thank you, Brawny.  You&#039;ve saved my life with your insigtful demonstration of popular herbs and spices.</i>  Is there a situation where paper towels like these would  compliment someone&#039;s wonderful decorating in their kitchen?  I hope and pray that I will never meet that person.  When, in the history of the universe, would it be necessary to compliment your kitchen drapes with your <i>PAPER TOWELS</i>?  Surely plain white would suffice.  I&#039;m sure you could get various colors of paper towels, if you absolutely must match your doilies.  But why, after all we&#039;ve been through, after countless wars and other threats to our existance, why would it be necessary to print the names and likenesses of several of our favorate eating spices onto the devices we use to clean up dog crap?  Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, you can do to paper towels will eliminate the fact that they are used to clean up dog crap, and I promise you that little blue pictures of parsley will not make cleaning spilled wine out of your brand new $10,000 couch any more pleasant.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I could see why someone would want to print things onto paper towels.  Look at all the prime advertising space avaliable there.  Paper towel companies could make a fortune selling space to AOL and Pepsi.  I can&#039;t believe nobody has thought of this before.  Everyone buys paper towels.  It&#039;s a necessity, just like soap, milk, bread, and oreos.  There are entire aisles devoted to them in the grocery stores.  How can Pepsi start to make advertisements in video games, yet never once think to print their logo onto paper towels?  Don&#039;t misread me, here.  I would absolutely hate it if they started doing that, but I would give up paper towels if they stop trying to ruin my favorite movie characters with their horrible commercials.  It&#039;s a trade off.  It doesn&#039;t have to be Pepsi, either.  Imagine wiping the grime off of your stove top.  It&#039;s difficult, it&#039;s baked on, and it&#039;s leaving streaks.  Now look at your paper towel you have there.  'Is cleaing that stove top tough?  Try new Grindex stove cleaner and mass insecticide.  It&#039;ll take the &#039;rub&#039; out of &#039;scrub&#039; !'  I&#039;m not saying it would be a good thing; I&#039;m just saying that I&#039;m suprised nobody has thought of it before.  We now have advertisements on our advertisements.  Why did someone think to put pictures of herbs and spices on paper towels <i>before</i> they thought to put advertisements on them?  That&#039;s all I&#039;m asking.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>While we are putting study sheets onto paper towels, however, I have several ideas there.  I have, from time to time, needed to know how many teaspoons go into a tablespoon.  I often find myself asking how many tablespoons of butter are in a pound.  I occasionally need to know how to clean various substances out of a pair of pants. Wouldn&#039;t the world be so much better if they printed those sort of things onto paper towels?  Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to look down and see, 'Animal wastes can be disposed of in a bush or used to fertilize a garden.' You can&#039;t tell me that it would be any more expensive than printing pictures of herbs and spices.  Bounty paper towel company could sell several different series of paper towels.  The college student<sup>tm</sup> line of paper towels could have tips for cooking ramen noodles, or the way to clean beer vomit out of a carpet printed in goofy colorful text.  The classroom<sup>tm</sup> series could have multiplication tables on them, or the alphabet in cursive.  When we had cursive tests in 3rd grade, I could have asked to blow my nose, grab a piece of paper towel, and get the answers to the test!  They could make a series of paper towels for the military that have common iraqi phrases on them, or Bounty could have a line of paper towels with pictures showing the soldiers which vehicles not to shoot at.  Maybe that&#039;s the problem with all the friendly fire over there.  Those guys go to the bathroom, they wash their hands, and then they forget which of the airplanes are friendly airplanes!  I can see a G.I. coming out of a latrine thinking <i>hmmm, so that&#039;s what a cinnamon plant looks like -- OH SHIT, that tank is attacking!</i>.  These are but a fraction of the possibilities here.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It&#039;s time the paper towel industry stepped up to the plate and delivered the American people a paper towel to be proud of.  It&#039;s time for a paper towel that will lead the way into the 21 century!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

It was such a painfully clich&Atilde;&copy;d &#039;teen-age&#039; gathering, and it was very unnatural for me.  It was interesting, because I saw a friend of mine that I haven&#039;t seen for a while.  A guy who has always offered an inteligent conversation, and who is probably reading this.  It was nice to see him again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sat around a bonfire, My Friend Ben and I, with a bunch of clich&Atilde;&copy;d &#039;teen-age&#039; people.  The girl who was hosting the thing had her car parked nearby.  The door was open, and the speakers were inadequately trying to fill the air with her custom mix CD&#039;s that she must have waited weeks to show off to her friends.  She sat there waiting for someone to mention the name of the current band or the delightful choice of one song or another.  Most of the people there were strangers to me, even the few who supposedly graduated with me.  My Friend Ben showed off his amazing ability to connect any two actors in 6 steps or less.  I had to think for a while, but I gave him Danny Jon-Jules (one of the vampires from Blade 2) and Zach Braff.  He connected them in 5 steps.  Bastard.  I got revenge, though.  I then said, 'Jessica Alba and . . . Ronald Reagan!'  I win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were other people there.  A girl who needed to put more clothes on spent most of the time talking to someone else on her cell phone.  She would occasionally say something sexual just to get everyone&#039;s attention.  When she got off the phone, she sprayed some lighter fluid on the fire.  I told her to get closer to the fire.  She told me I was an idiot.  I told her (well, in my mind a little while later) to put some pants on.  There were other kids trying desperately to be punk or to be different, but they all just look and act like every other high school student. You could cut the angst with a knife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A house sat just down the road.  A house where a girl used to live.  A girl I am still in love with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess we&#039;re having a bit of a party tonight for this holiday thing that celebrates a paticular universal mistake.  I went with my parents to Wal Mart to get supplies.  They bought 'Dr. Thunder.'  I want to stress that Wal-Mart brand drinks are not equivelant to their non-evil counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan was in <i>The Killers</i> with Angie Dickinson, who was in <i>Pay it Forward</i> with Haley Joel Osment.

Don&#039;t be afraid to make me feel bad or anything, because it would be like pouring gasoline on an out of control forest fire.  My life is spiraling downwards, and considering where it started the summer, that is extremely suprising.  Everything seems to be going wrong, and then you realize that what only seems to be going wrong is in fact going wrong.  Right when I feel like I might have one problem under control, something comes up and punches me right in the ribs (literally).  Several thoughts spring to mind, which are quickly ambushed and gobbled up by the negativity that set up permanent residence.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>I&#039;m going back to school soon, so all this crappy summer will be over soon,</i> I often tell myself.  The problem with that is omni-fold.  A.) I am so completely not ready to go back to school, from the myriad of hygenic supplies I need to remember to bring and then buy to the various computer parts I stupidly bought that need to be built into some sort of computer that I can take, to the absolute mess my body is in, to the fact that I&#039;ve been working all summer and I don&#039;t even have $1000 to cover the entire year at school, to the paperwork and other crap that I have to figure out.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>2.)  I don&#039;t even know where (or whith whom) I will be living this semester.  Thank you, Chris Fancher.  I recently found out that Meredith Hall might be moving us to a smaller room so that we don&#039;t have to deal with a random third roomate.  Right now I don&#039;t know which of those options would be worse, but I&#039;m sure that they will decide for us.  I have no doubts that I will be finding out which option is worse this year.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>C.)  I am not looking forward to my classes this semester, nor do I like my schedule.  Sticking blunt objects underneath my fingernails immediately comes to mind when I think of other, less painful, activities that I could be doing come August.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>IV.)  I am completely broke.  Well, I will probably have about a thousand dollars by the time I&#039;m off to school.  That&#039;s after I decided not to get most of the things I wanted to get this summer.  Last year I had about $2500 and I went a couple hundred into debt by the end of the year.  I&#039;m so screwed.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>5.)  The one thing, the <i>one</i> thing that I really wanted to finish above all else this summer was finish my new website.  After working on it all summer, I am not done and only in fact about half way done with it.  Again, I&#039;m screwed.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>It could be worse,</i> I think.  Yeah, that&#039;s the sad part.  The one universal truth that we can all count on is that life will always find new ways to make things worse.  When I wake up in the mornings feeling like absolute crap, I am always excited to find out what things will go wrong today.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>At least I have no friends around mucking things up by distracting me from worrying about all this.</i>  Sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

The rule is that you have to write only one line of text, and you have to be semi coherant.  I started writing a story with Ben, and it was getting pretty good when Adam and Scott both joined in.

It was brought over a long time ago from Africa by a greedy slave owner who thought it could be used to feed cattle.  Johnsongrass grows very tall very fast, so originally, it looked like a very capable plant to feed livestock.  Irony makes this world go round, it seems.  Johnsongrass is poisonous, especially to cattle.  By the time this was discovered, it was too late.  Now johnsongrass is a weed, outlawed in the United States.  It spread from the original colonies it was introduced to all the way across the continent.  Landowners face severe fines if they are caught with johnsongrass on their property.  The weed spread, and now it has adapted to look just like a modern run of the mill genetically engineered corn plant.  It can be found in cornfields when the corn is at its highest level of growth.  Johnsongrass grows taller than the corn, so you&#039;ll see it&#039;s wild tassles sticking up above the canopy granted by the fields of corn.  In only a couple hundred years, johnson grass has evolved to look exactly like corn to make us less likely to destroy it.  Officers spend countless hours flying over fields searching for johnson grass to stop its growth.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I really relate to johnson grass.  It stands tall above the other plants around it, trying to keep hold of the originality that it deserves.  However, the weed&#039;s entire survival depends on being able to fit in with those around it.  It desperately tries to blend in with its peers, but it can&#039;t eccape the fact that it is different.  Poisonous and useless, it grows wherever it can, using its mild similarity to other plants as the only way it stays alive.  It doesn&#039;t belong here.  It was meant for a different world.  It was brought here to fulfil someone&#039;s whims, but it was unable to satisfy the human&#039;s insatiable greed.  It has no place here.  There is no purpose for it on this continent.  Nobody wants it here.  People put it upon themselves to destroy it whenever they can.  Humans put it here, and now for the same reasons they destroy it.  It can do nothing but exist.  There is nothing else that it can do.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I definitely relate to this weed.  As I careen along watching fields passing by, I think about those plants doomed only to be destroyed.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I&#039;m allergic to johnsongrass.

      "text": "<p>This semester is it.  In the next several months, my path will be set.  It may not be from any direct decision from myself, but by the natural course of events.  Whatever the case, the end of this semester could very possibly be the dawning of a completely new direction.</p>\r\n<p>The term 'new direction' might be a bit misleading.  That almost infers that I had a direction before.  I currently have no direction for myself.  Everything I once felt like I wanted has changed.  Every dream I thought I had is - well it isn&#039;t destroyed, just shaken.  The once perfect dream that I once had - the dream that I can&#039;t even seem to describe anymore - is clouded and obscured by a series of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.</p>\r\n<p>I currently have a full fledged war inside my head.  It is not a simple army vs. army war.  When is internal conflict ever like that?  This is a cold war.  My brain is at war with itsself, and neither side seems to know that it is at war with the other.  It&#039;s like I am leading several sepparate lives, each with it&#039;s own friends and goals and even dreams.  I suppose this isn&#039;t extremely odd, but it&#039;s not making my life at all managable.  I seriously need a purpose, and nothing I can think of is working.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>My shoes never stay tied.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I was walking home from the first rehearsal for the play I&#039;ve been swept up into.  I felt a soft pressure against my left lower leg, just above the ankle.  In between strides, I glanced down at my feet pressing against the sidewalk in a tedius alternating pattern.  My right shoelace, a long blue string weaving through my shoe in curious geometric patterns, was loosened, and the ends were stretched out.  The ends of the shoelace were chaotically flying around my leg with each step.  I&#039;m always intrigued by the pattern the shoelace tips make as they swirl around my ankle in mid stride.  When in a certain rhythm, they alternate back and forth, wrapping first around my ankle crossing each other, and then flying back wrapping around the other way with each time my foot moves forward.  This time, walking along the sidewalk on the south side of State Street, the shoelace was not in the proper rhythm.  Then ends of the very loosly tied string were dangling randomly around their anchors, occasionally applying a soft pressure against my left lower leg, just above the ankle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am always tying these shoes.  The once perfect, pristine finish of blue and white is now dulled, stained by dirt, time, and the millions of hazards a shoe encounters on a daily basis.  They were once perfect white.  They were once covered by a nice interlocking pattern of perfect blue suade.  Now, like the shoes they replaced, they are losing that perfect appearance.  For some reason, these shoes refuse to stay tied.  My left shoe, currently obediently staying within the parameters laid down for it when it was made, remained tied only because on the way to rehearsal when it was loose, I tied it with a double knot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knots are things that I have never been able to understand.  Somehow, looping a string around itself provides enough force to stop almost anything from moving.  Knots have always been a metaphore for marriage.  I can&#039;t managed to keep my shoelaces to maintain their knots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shoelaces have one purpose.  They prevent shoes from falling off.  I wish my life were that easy.  Is life that easy?  What is my purpose?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theatre has always been easy for me.  It serves a very specific and important purpose in my life.  It gives me a purpose.  I don&#039;t mean that it gives me a purpose to be alive or a reason to exist.  Theatre provides a momentary escape from the uncertainty of my life.  When I am assuming a role, for that tiny instant I have a purpose.  Whether it be to deliver a certain line, to perform a certain action (or let someone perform a certain action on me), or to simply walk across a stage, for that moment in time I have a purpose.  I don&#039;t care about the audience.  I don&#039;t care about anything else in the entire world.  For that moment, I am a person with a distinct and universally important purpose.  For that moment, I have a shoe to tie down.  I&#039;m so uncomfortable with social situations.  I have always been uncomfortable dealing with most people I have to deal with.  I never know what to say.  I never know what to do.  When I have a script, though, I know exactly what to say, and exactly what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is, once the purpose is fulfilled, once the performance is over, once I return to my conciousness, I am again lost.  Once the purpose is gone, I am untied, to dangle randomly around, occasionally applying a soft pressure against the universe&#039;s left lower leg, just above the ankle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this what I have come to?  Comparing myself to shoelaces?</p>",

I&#039;m currently sitting in my physics class, and since I can&#039;t stand to listen to him talk, I decided to do something productive and post something on my website about him.  He is without a doubt the worst teacher I&#039;ve ever had.  He talks like the comedian Ben Stein, except that he does it naturally and it&#039;s even less funny.  He really has one of the most deeply boring personalities on the face of the planet.  I often think of him sitting at family gatherings, prattling on about random confusing things, boring the crap out of all of the children who were dragged to the thing.  His family members (probably his adult grandchildren) would all look at each other and feel extremely sorry for his students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am one of those poor unfortunate students.  I can sit here listening to him ramble, and I learn absolutely nothing.  We have these electronic response pads, and he randomly gives us multiple choice questions to answer with them.  We usually get them wrong (by &#039;we&#039; I mean the entire lecture hall full of students) and he chuckles to himself and explains why we are all incompetant.  The problem is that he doesn&#039;t seem to feel the need to teach us the material covered in the question.  He doesn&#039;t seem to understand that this is the physics class for students who didn&#039;t take any physics in high school.  We don&#039;t know what he is talking about most of the time.  He might as well give us the final on the first day of class, and then spend the rest of the semester explaining to us all why we were wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m lucky that I have Chris around to help me with the homework.

      "text": "Chapter 1, Part 1\r\n\t\t\t<p>Read</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>A tear landed on the cold metal floor.  The floor shook with the force of the shuttle&#039;s engines.  Transport Lieutenant Mark Soren paced from the fore of the passenger compartment to the rear.  His uniform boots were loudly knocking against the metal floor panels as he walked.  His hands were wrapped behind his back, his back was straight, his strides even.  In the front of the shuttle, the 'In Transit' light was on, accompanied by the constant warning beep which is standard for the fleet&#039;s transport craft.  In nearby seats, some petty officers were loudly debating football scores.  Outside Shuttle 15-23, the SDS <i>Vigor</i> slowly drifted along, awaiting her shuttle back.  Behind the cruiser, Morsus was slowly rotating about Beta Centauri.  Behind Beta Centauri hovered an infinite universe of infinite discoveries.  A tear slid down my cheek and landed on the cold metal floor.  It was the only sound I heard.  It was the only thing I saw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am Lieutenant Tristan Marcus, command Lieutenant for the Solan Defense Fleet.  I graduated with honors from the SDF academy on Earth.  My first position was as an Ensign on a small frigate.  I was one of 8 officers on the ship.  Earth apparently decided that my paticular talents would be best suited on a larger, more active ship, so I was transferred to the <i>Vigor</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the shuttle carying Leutenant Soren and I left the point defence perimeter of the <i>Vigor</i>, the last 4 years were swirling around in my head.  As shuttle 15-23 set a course for the surface of planet Morsus, I thought about all of the things that I would be losing.   I was leaving the ship to be court-martialed.  I had to wait on Morsus for the next SDF ship that would be headed to Earth.  The Solan schedules listed no ship going from Morsus to Earth for at least 5 local days, so I was stuck there with nothing but my remorse.  I didn&#039;t mind leaving the fleet.  I wasn&#039;t afraid of having to deal with a dishonorable discharge.  I didn’t really care at all.  I had friends on that ship, though.  I felt like I had a family on that ship.  I made the terrible mistake of falling in love with a lieutenant named Carys Patrick.  A court-martial meant that I would never see her - or any of my other friends in the fleet - ever again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morsus worried me, as well.  I had never met a Terran before, and I wasn’t excited to be one of the only humans on this planet.  At the time, I assumed that I deserved it.  I was being court-martialed after all.  I felt like I didn’t deserve to live.  I didn’t want to live.  Not without her.  I joined the academy so many years ago because I had nothing better to do with my life.  I don’t have any particularly useful skills, and there isn’t much that I enjoy doing.  As I watched Lieutenant Soren’s feet pass by me, I would have given anything to go back and live my life over again.  I wished that I had never joined the academy.  I had no idea what I had ahead of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shuttle hit the Morsus atmosphere and I watched patterns of the ships shields dance around the window.  We still had 20 minutes before the shuttle would reach the garrison, so I closed my eyes.  I had a dream that I was stranded alone in the middle of a vast desert.  I walked and walked, but I got nowhere.  I was clutching something in my hand, but I couldn&#039;t tell what it was.  Then everything dissappeared and all I could see was Carys&#039;s face.  She looked sad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leutenant Soren woke me up when we landed.</p>\r\n",

I have apparently lost about 90% of my audience, so there isn&#039;t much point to spending too much on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So for anyone who cares anymore (Mom and Dad), I am thinking about leaving Purdue.  I&#039;m thinking about it more and more every day.  The problem is that once I think that I have to decide what I&#039;m going to do instead, and so far the answer to that question has eluded me.  I want to leave this lousy computer graphics department and do something that I can 1, do, and 2, actually care about.  I want to go into writing or anything with less manual art.  I can&#039;t draw, and I never could.  That&#039;s why I wanted to go into computer graphics, because I can animate things very well, but I can&#039;t draw them at all.  I didn&#039;t think that I would have to draw at all in order to animate, but I guess I was wrong.  Maybe I&#039;ll just CODO into computer science and get a degree in that, just for something to do.  I have a feeling that I won&#039;t actually use a degree for the information it teaches me.  I just need something to say that I graduated and I am competant, and I need to do something that will give me enough free time to work on independant projects like this site.  Independant projects are the things that will get me jobs, not degrees or grades.  Those are the the thoughts swirling around in my head right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope that I can be accepted a little more into the play, because I really need some friends.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

It&#039;s just his way, and I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way.  Everyone has their annoying faults.  I have recently been tested in my patience to keep him around.  He comes in my room (there is a history of annoyance with him and my room, after all) and uses my couch, my television, Mike&#039;s Xbox, and our bathroom.  Then he makes very asinine comments about us and the things that we love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a Cameron bashing post, so stick with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has recently reminded me just why I am friends with him in the first place, and why we all put up with his asinine nature.  He sent me an email in response to my last post.  He didn&#039;t want to leave it as a comment because he was afraid of being cut off by the 2000 character limit.  I told him that I would upload it, and now I&#039;ve decided to do it as a full post.  I hope whoever randomly stumbled upon this site is entertained by my incessant descriptions of how I am finding myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just to stay on topic here . . . I am still the only person who doesn&#039;t use a tray in the residence dining halls.  Using trays is so conformist.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Cameron&#039;s Email</p>\r\n\t\t\t<span style=&#039;font-family: courier new, arial&#039;>\r\n<p>Shauvon,</p>\r\n<p>For what it&#039;s worth. I&#039;m thinking about leaving CGT too. Personally I don&#039;t think CS is right for you though, especially if you are looking for more free time to work on independent projects. CGT has one of the lowest workloads of any major I&#039;ve seen at this school, it may be stupid work, but at least there typically isn&#039;t that much of it. 211 is an exception of course, but you&#039;ll have that occasionally and you won&#039;t ever have Maicher again, so if you make it through this you&#039;re done with him. Also CS has a lot of lab science requirements and I don&#039;t think you&#039;d care for that very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly what I think you should do is stay in CGT, do just enough to get by, and work the next couple of years on your modeling portfolio. You are a better modeler than almost anyone I&#039;ve seen in CGT and that includes upperclassmen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the coursework isn&#039;t going to help you, so say fuck it and do the work that you want to do. It&#039;s unfortunate that few people would hire you without a bachelor&#039;s degree, but that&#039;s the nature of the beast. You&#039;ve still got a lot of modeling stuff that you could learn and I&#039;d be surprised if you didn&#039;t get hired to do that kind of work out of school even with the portfolio you have now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many things that upset me about this post, one being that you claim to not have any friends, which hurts me because I didn&#039;t see any sign of this self-induced solitude coming. We may be assholes, but we do care about you and you need to tell us that you need us rather than posting angsty, vague messages meant to guilt us into expressing concern over you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing that really annoys me about these rants of yours is that you claim that the CGT coursework is wasting your time and not teaching you anything. \r\nYou claim that you want more time for independent projects, but when you do have that time you sit around for 12 hours in a weekend playing Fable or one of the umpteen other games that you have or buy on a fairly regular basis. \r\nMaybe if you actually spent some time working on your projects, like the Half- Life mod or adding the Imperial Guard to the Warhammer game, we&#039;d take your complaints a little more seriously. It seems to me that the person causing you the most harm here is you. You bitch incessantly, but you never do anything to fix your situation. I am more than willing to help you in any capacity that I can, but you never talk to me about your problems and you seem to do very little to help yourself. In the end I am your friend and am willing to help you out in whatever way I can, whether that be morale support or contributing to one of your projects or just bitching at you to keep you working, but there is nothing I can do if you don&#039;t feel like motivating yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are in full control of your life and nobody else can make your decisions for you. I know I may come off as a little harsh in here, but I&#039;m only trying to be perfectly honest with you. I think you are capable of great deal. You&#039;re a much more talented artist than I am, whether you choose to believe that or not. You&#039;re also a much better modeler than I will probably ever be a web designer. I&#039;d hate to see you squandor all of your promise because of self- imposed angst and outright laziness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was going to post this to your journal, but I figured you might not want it to be on public record. It&#039;s probably vastly over 2000 characters anyway as I have a tendency to ramble. Also, don&#039;t let a lack of web traffic discourage you, I hardly get any hits unless the webcams are up. I do check your journal every day though, so you have at least one viewer. Whoever posted that other, rather eloquent, response clearly reads your journal often too, so that&#039;s something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember, I&#039;m here if you need me, but I can&#039;t help you if you won&#039;t talk to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron</p>\r\n</span>",

The rays of sunlight could not have chosen a more beautiful subject to illuminate.  There are fields of roses, ancient forests, miles of calm ocean, and fresh snow covered mountains which are lit every single day by lucky rays of sunlight.  Those rays, the ones that light the beautiful things on this planet, are jealous of the ones that come to Earth to light her face.  It is for those rays of light that I came along.

      "text": "<p>So yesterday I lost my bike, I lost my soap, I lost quite a bit of my self esteem, and I lost quite a bit of my hope.  Then I had to lose something else.  Mom, you&#039;ll really enjoy this.  For the play I&#039;m in, I had to have my hair cut.  A great deal of my hair was removed, and with it went a great deal of my sense of originality.  I sat in the chair, a beautiful young girl stood behind me wearing several shirts. (She had like 5 shirts on, and they didn&#039;t seem to be able to do the job of one.  I&#039;m not complaining)  First went the clippers, then the scissors, then the clippers again.  Handfulls of hair fell on my lap; clumps of curly red hair bounced on my shoulders.  In one lock of hair was my pride, my sense of accomplishment.  Another one contained my faith in the future, my ability to have hope that things will maintain some sort of continuity.  She methodically removed my hair from my head.  She removed my confusion, my lack of perception.  Down fell my constant nagging sense of failure.  The buzz of the cippers removed my fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to say that the haircut cleansed my soul, and now I am returned to a neutral state, ready to take on life.  I really want to say that, but I won&#039;t.  I am still the same insecure and lonely person I was before.  The only difference is that now I can see my ears in the mirror.  A haircut causes a great deal of excitement for only about five minutes.  I went to practice, put my stuff down, and realized that everyone was looking at me.  They all said their version of 'it looks really good' and went on their way.  Nothing more needs to be said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have apparently broken my mp3 player now, as well.  It fell about 3 feet from my chair, and now the hard drive is damaged and it won&#039;t play.  I didn&#039;t just have 1700 songs on it, but I also used it to back up my computer.  Those things are all permanently gone.  I can&#039;t blame this one on thievery.  Only one person is to blame.  It really makes me wonder what else I am going to lose.\r\n\r\n<p>At night I sort through my day.  I feel a great warmth in the distance.  A bright light is calling me, but I don&#039;t know how to get to it.  A vast hope is just out of reach.  I don&#039;t know how to reach it.  I can&#039;t reach it. Then it disappears, and I go to sleep.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

The poor officer probably nearly failed in the academy, so they sent him to this terrible post.  His wrinkled pants and crooked hat showed how incompetant he was.  Competant ensigns almost never let their uniforms go to such a state.</p>\r\n<p>'Y-yes sir.'  He sloppily saluted one more time, and then he turned to lead me into the garrison.  Lieutenant Soren and his petty officers would see to it that my belongings would get off the shuttle.  They worked quickly.  The shuttle began leaving almost before we entered the garrison.  With a blast of its engines, my life as I knew it ended.</p>\r\n<p>The landing pad was about 50 meters from the actual garrison.  The place wasn&#039;t designed with asthetics in mind.    A simple box sat above ground, with a 10 meter tower prjecting from the center.  Most of the complex was underground.  The entire thing was surrounded by a rather tall concrete wall, which blocked my view of the rest of the planet.  From what I could tell, it was pretty much like Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Ensign Green led me down to the main office.  The plaque outside read 'Jonathan Ward, Lieutenant Junior Grade.'  I outranked him.</p>\r\n<p>'Sir, welcome to Morsus.'</p>\r\n<p>I nodded, and shook his outstreached hand.</p>\r\n<p>'Would you like a tour of our facilities?'  He must not have had many visiters.</p>\r\n<p>'Maybe later,' I said.</p>\r\n<p>He was visibly dissappointed.  'Maybe some other time, then.'</p>\r\n<p>'Maybe.  Can you show me to my quarters?'  I was hoping that a tiny garrison would have the space to give me a room.</p>\r\n<p>'Of course.  Ensign Green will show you.'</p>\r\n<p><i>Perfect.</i>  I could have ordered him to take me himself, but I didn&#039;t really care.  I was very tired, and I was looking forward to being able to sleep for more than four hours at once.  The poor young ensign took me to a tiny room in the basement of the building.  It was obviously Ward&#039;s quarters.  As his superior, he was required to give me the largest room in the facility.  I really hope that it didn&#039;t mean that he had to share a room with Ensign Green.  My small chest of everything I owned was already in the room, waiting for me.  I didn&#039;t even bother with it.  I took my jacket off and went right for the bed.  It was painfully uncomfortable, but I didn&#039;t notice at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes dreams can just be random, and sometimes they don&#039;t make any sense.  Sometimes dreams can be pretty prophetic, though. If only I could tell at the time.</p>\r\n<p>I had a dream that I was alone in the middle of a vast desert.  I was holding something in my hand, but I couldn&#039;t tell what it was.  A SDF shuttle was hovering in front of me.  I could see Carys standing in the shuttle.  She had her back to me.  Then the shuttle flew into the distance and dissappeared.  The shuttle disappeared and I was alone.</p>",

      "text": "<p>I just thought I would give a little update about the group project that I was in for CGT211.  My good friend <a href=http://www.ontariosuave.com>Extra Cameron, the Happy Canadian</a> was also in the group.  The project was to create pre-production materials for a movie / video / whatever of our choice.  Extra Cameron, in a stroke of genius, decided that we should design a video for the Death Cab For Cutie song, <i>What Sarah Said</i>, from their new album.  The song is hella depressing, so I won&#039;t go into huge detail about it.  Just click the link below to get all the scoopage on said project.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Yes, this link right here.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>What is pre-production, you ask?  Well, we were to design all of the aspects of the video, which according to Kellen Maicher, the godlike professor, boils down to Characters, Environments, and Props.  Extra Cameron designed a couple characters, the amazing Tyler Kupferer did another couple characters, Samantha the Senior designed the props and things, and Slick Stephen worked on one of the main environments.  (I just made those knick names up)  The song centers around a hospital (in that the entire thing takes place there).  Therefore, the environment was a hospital, the characters were patients and nurses, and the extra things were stuff like exit signs, coke machines, coffee cups, etcetera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My part of the project was to do a couple of the environments.  For the last 4 summers, I&#039;ve been working at an architecture firm previsualizing environments, so I figured it would be pretty easy for me to do a couple hospital renderings.  The requirements of the project stated that we had to create a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>raster image</a>.  There were many requirements about what the images was supposed to be like, but it didn&#039;t say anything about what program was to be used to create the image.  It&#039;s theoretically an Adobe Photoshop class, but I thought it was rediculous to render an environment in Photoshop, so I used 3d Studio Max.  Yeah, I cheated a little bit.  It&#039;s a raster image that fits every requirement for the project, so there is nothing wrong with it.  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru class=black>I&#039;m just like Captain Kirk.  'I don&#039;t like to lose.'</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, here are my images:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I had do do one of the hallways of the hospital, complete with rooms (albeit empty).  Several people have thought that the first one is a photograph.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=center><a href=../assets/images/project/hallway.png><img src=../assets/images/project/hallwaythumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/room0249.png><img src=../assets/images/project/room0249thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The sign at the end of the hallway points in the various directions for the Cardiology, Pulminology, Out Patient, ICU, and CGT 211 Student wards.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Another section that I had to do was the waiting room.  I went ahead and did the area outside of the waiting room, too, because I love that reflective floor.  I designed those light fixtures because I saw them somewhere and I thought they looked cool.  I wanted to have as many harsh shadows as possible, to heighten the tension and depressing . . . ness of it all.  I think I saw those lights in a mexican restaurant somewhere.  Strange choice for mexican restaurant, but excellent choice for depressing waiting room.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=center>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0001.png><img src=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0001thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0002.png><img src=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0002thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0003.png><img src=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0003thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0005.png><img src=../assets/images/project/waiting_room0005thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing behind the curtains.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>And finally, I was in charge of the outside of the hospital, which meant that I had to design an entire hospital complex, parking garage and all.  (don&#039;t let me fool you, I really enjoyed it)  You may notice several things.  It is raining.  There are no windows on the actual hospital (this is because the shot in the video is from above, zooming away from the guy sitting on the ground, so you never see the hospital walls).  The parking garage only has lights on the first row of columns (it already took about 10 minutes to render one frame, I didn&#039;t want to make it take any longer by doubling the lights).  Finally, you might notice the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffer>z-buffer</a> error on the large windows of the diagonal wall in the image named 'ground0005.png' (some of the windows don&#039;t display because they are so close to the surface of the wall, and I was too lazy to fix it).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=center>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/sweep0003.png><img src=../assets/images/project/sweep0003thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/sweep0008.png><img src=../assets/images/project/sweep0008thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/ground0005.png><img src=../assets/images/project/ground0005thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n<a href=../assets/images/project/ground0006.png><img src=../assets/images/project/ground0006thumb.jpg /></a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ambulance is just two white boxes with the word 'Wambulance' printed all over it.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p>Now for the technical info.  Let me just get this out of the way, so I can feel special for knowing so many big words.  You can skip to the next paragraph if you don&#039;t want to read the mumbo jumbo.  Stick with me, though, because the ending is really good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two scenes were rendered in 3d studio max 7, using radiosity calculations and photometric lights.  The hallway scene and the waiting room are connected together.  All of the textures were created from scratch in Adobe Photoshop, with the sole exception being the magazine covers in the waiting room.  The floor reflection was achieved using a raytraced material.  All of the objects were modeled with simple primitives.  The outdoor scene contains a total of 144 lights, and the hallway / waiting room contains 39.  I think that about does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I was afraid that I would get in trouble for not using photoshop to render the scenes, they didn&#039;t seem to care at all.  We turned in our project and awaited the presentations.  This week, on Monday and Tuesday, every group had 5 minutes to present their work, which included at least two pieces per group member, and around 100 storyboards.  Five minutes was undoubtedly not enough time.  Anyway, our group, which was called Team Steel Blue, by the way, decided that we should make a video for our presentation, instead of making some stupid powerpoint presentation or something.  Good old Tyler worked up a five minute video a la VH1&#039;s <i>Behind the Music</i>.  Neeless to say, we <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owned class=black>owned</a> everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all got an email from Professor Maicher yesterday, which explains how awesome we are.  Apparently he sent a copy to several other professors, who all thought it was great.  Although Maicher wants to teach us about the real professional world, he doesn&#039;t seem to have any problem with distributing our creative property.  It&#039;s no big deal, because it&#039;s definitely awesome enough to want to show everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only one group in the class will earn an A on this project, whith everyone else geting a B or lower.  I&#039;ll be sure to post the grade that we got, but judging from the other presentations, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m happy to say that I have a copy of the video for your viewing pleasure.  Feel free to distribute it all you want, but it would be nice if you give me an email so I can give Tyler an email asking to use it.  The credit for all the filming and editing goes to Tyler, who is definitely one of the greatest minds of our generation.  We all worked really hard on this project, so everyone take a look at <i>211: Behind the Project</i>.  It&#039;s in Windows Media format, and for that I appologize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=../assets/images/project/steelbluepresentation.wmv>Team Steel Blue:  Behind the Project (57.6 MB)</a></p>",

I&#039;ve been wanting to render a space scene for a while now, so I started playing around with 3d Studio on Friday.  I re-developed my intimate relationship with 3ds while working on the <a href=../content/news.php?post=00093>211 project</a>.  I quickly worked up a nice planet + ring scene, and I started modelling a space fighter.  I made both of them up as I went, and they are turning out pretty well.  I still have to skin the fighter, and insert a couple of them into the planet.  I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll have some free time at home next week to work on that some more.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/unsortable/planet.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/unsortable/fighter.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>\r\n<p>Anyway, all day yesterday I was switching between working on the space fighter and playing <i>Quake 4</i>, which really redeems itsself well in the later levels.  Neal, Cameron, and Chris came back pretty late in the day (around 7) because they went to Bloomington for the football game.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/drunk/neal%20055.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top rowspan=3>\r\n<p>I was surfing the internet for information about building a media center PC (I really want to build one), and Neal came in to the room with a big jug of orange juice.  He locked the door, and went into the other room.  I was confused about what they were doing in there, but I was more interested in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turion_64 class=black>AMD Turion 64</a> processors, so I didn&#039;t really think about it too much.</p>\r\n<p>My fingers slid across the computer, pressing 'flag' and 'L' to lock my computer, so nobody finds my collection of Star Trek fan fiction.  I journeyed over into the other room, and found the four guys (Mike Davis had joined them at this point) sitting around drinking orange juice.  They had apparently aquired some sort of special tonic which they were mixing with the juice.  It seems that they didn&#039;t want anyone else asking to have some of their orange juice, so Neal locked the door to keep the juice-hounds out.  By the time I came into the room, half of the 1.75 litre bottle of tonic was finished.  They must have been worried about someone finding out about something, because the bottle had quite a bit of proof in it.  I don&#039;t like anything without Tang or Dr. Pepper in it, so I didn&#039;t try any of their orange juice.</p>\r\n<p>Chris took what was left of our koolaide and mixed it with his juice.

      "text": "<p><i>The Matrix: The Path of Neo</i> is one of the worst games I have ever played.  How in the world could someone have played that game and decided that it&#039;s ready to be released.  There are graphical glitches every 5 seconds (not even exaggerating), and animation glitches every single time you do <i>anything</i>.  It brings several interesting points to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m starting a list.  Let this be not the definitive, but the ever adapting list of rules for game development.  They aren&#039;t mandatory or anything, it&#039;s just things you should do if you want to make a good game.  Go ahead and follow Shiny&#039;s plan of releasing whatever filth you come up with just to milk the cash cow.  However, if you don&#039;t want 50 million suicides on your hands, you might want to think about making a <i>decent</i> game.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Shauvon&#039;s simple rules of game development.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>1.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Do not release a game with obvious bugs.</b></p>\r\n<p>Okay, if it occasionally crashes on certain video cards with a paticular driver, it&#039;s fine.  If some random side NPC has a weird animation bug, don&#039;t worry about it.  If you&#039;re way over budget already, just relase it.</p>\r\n<p>If all of your dynamic lights cause bizarre texture corruption, or every other animation screws up and ends up looking terrible, or characters often randomly disappear from the screen in the middle of a cutscene, or the graphics will completely and totally die (absolutely nothing works correctly) on certain systems when turned all the way up, or  the terrible hit collision system causes walls that the player hasn&#039;t touched to explode on the other side of a room, or the camera just decides to go through a wall and make everything impossible, or character models have various polygons sticking out of them, or LOD changes occur and random times right in front of the camera, or bullets shoot backwards when you point the gun at a certain angle, you should do something about it.  Any one of those glitches could ruin a perfectly good game.  <i>Path of Neo</i> happens to exibit all of them, and many more.  They all happen frequently enough to make it obvious in the first several minutes of play, too.</p>\r\n<p>For the love of God, just play through the game ONCE before you release it.  This is what Beta testing is for.  Patches are fine, but a game shouldn&#039;t have this many problems when it comes out.</p>\r\n<p>I had to laugh at one point in <i>Path of Neo</i>.  After failing a jumping puzzle for the 10th time, Neo reappears at the beginning and says 'This is getting old.'  <i>No kiding.</i>  They even aknowlege that the game has problems, but they aren&#039;t willing to address them.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>2.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Extra useless levels need to be removed.</b></p>\r\n<p>You may think that you are doing gamers a favor by including more levels, but really you&#039;re destroying a good game.  For example, after defeating agent Smith in the subway station (an infuriating and stupid battle, by the way), Neo gets stuck in a different subway station which has been corrupted by bad code.  He has to jump around a badly modeled train car and hit the brake to get out of an infinite loop.  Then he goes and fights Smith again in another station.  How was that important to the story?  It wasn&#039;t in the movie.  If they did write or even shoot the scene, they cut it out because it would have ruined the movie.  Why can&#039;t developers go through a game and cut out scenes and levels that aren&#039;t important?  Movie makers have been doing it for years now.</p>\r\n<p>Side quests are perfectly acceptable, but not for a first person shooter.  Bonus missions are great, but make them bonus missions instead of forcing the player to wade through piles of crap just to get back with the storyline.</p>\r\n<p>I would rather play a short game than a shit game.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>3.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>If you are going to make some gimic a key element of the game, make it something that the Player ejoys having.</b></p>\r\n<p><i>Max Payne</i> has bullet time.  <i>Aliens vs. Predator</i> has the ability to be the Alien.  <i>Dead to Rights</i> has bullet time.  <i>Messiah</i> has taking over people&#039;s bodies.  <i>Enter the Matrix</i> has bullet time.  <i>Brother&#039;s in Arms</i> has the ability to order your squad around.  <i>FEAR</i> has bullet time.  <i>Half Life 2</i> has the gravity gun.  <i>The Path of Neo</i> has bullet time.</p>\r\n<p>Bullet time is almost a new genre, it&#039;s used so much.  This rule should just be 'If you are going to use bullet time in a game, play <i>Max Payne</i> first.'  For some reason, the original <i>Max Payne</i> is still the only game to do it well.  The only exception to that is <i>FEAR</i> which is one of the most amazing games ever made.  In <i>Path of Neo</i>, the 'focus' button feels more like the 'make everything impossible to control and see' button.  Gun combat in <i>PoN</i> is the single worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to experience.  The only game that even comes close is <i>Enter the Matrix</i>.  When you try to dive in any direction in <i>PoN</i>, Neo flys twenty feet in the air, making it impossible to hit anything.  It shouldn&#039;t be so hard to do what <i>Max Payne</i> did so brilliantly.</p>\r\n<p>Please, if you are going to use a gimic in a game, make it a blessing like <i>Half Life 2</i>&#039;s Gravity Gun, not an eye-gouging annoyance like <i>PoN</i>&#039;s 'focus.'</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>4.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Just because you use DirectX 9, it doesn&#039;t mean you need to layer on every vertex and pixel effect possible.</b></p>\r\n<p>Just 5 minutes with <i>Path of Neo</i> and you&#039;ll start to hate bump mapping.  You&#039;ll hate it almost as much as ID software loves it.  They bump map everything, just because they can.  The difference is that ID uses normal maps to improve the detail in their levels (<i>Doom 3</i>, <i>Quake 4</i>), whereas in <i>PoN</i>, they use bump mapping to make his suit look wrinkly, but it just ends up looking like Neo has been severely stabbed repeatedly in random places.</p>\r\n<p><i>Anachronox</i> used the Quake 2 engine, and it still manages to tell a story infinitely better than <i>Path of Neo</i>, even without all of the vertex processing and pixel shaders.</p>\r\n<p>Keep it simple, and it will stay entertaining.  Good graphics can do a lot to improve a game, but lousy graphics can do so much more to ruin it.  As soon as you see Neo&#039;s terrible suit, you are taken out of the game.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>5.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Don&#039;t shoot yourself in the foot by butchering your storyline.</b></p>\r\n<p>Peter Jackson can tell us all about butchering stories, but he isn&#039;t here.  Peter is a good example, though.  I don&#039;t think we will ever know just why he felt it necessary to completely rewrite the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but it ruined the movies.  The Wachowski brothers (they made <i>The Matrix</i>, and they&#039;re also famous for being really creepy and scary), did the same thing with <i>Path of Neo</i>. They added stupid scenes, rearranged things, and changed important lines.  There is absolutely no reason for them to do any of that.  Playing the game, you can just see the Wachowskis wandering around the development studio, claiming to be 'gamers' and telling the poor developers to put a bunch of stupid ideas into the game, like the end boss battle where Neo has to fight a giant agent Smith made of buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Wachowski brothers,</p>\r\n<p>If you sit around all day watching anime and playing Playstation, you aren&#039;t a gamer.  If you think jumping puzzles are important to throw into every game ever made, you aren&#039;t a gamer.  If you think that the Playstation is the best gaming platform on the planet, <i>you aren&#039;t a gamer.</i></p>\r\n<p>I would tell you to stick to making movies, but you have proven your inadequacies there, too.  Just crawl back into the hole you came from, and stop torturing people.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>6.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Games fail as movies, and movies fail as games.</b></p>\r\n<p>I would really love for someone to prove me wrong here, but the truth is you can&#039;t.  The point of games is that they give the player the ability to choose his fate.  Movies are a completely different form of entertainment.  I wish they would stop trying.</p>\r\n<p>It&#039;s worse knowing that the following games will become movies:  <i>Half Life, Dungeon Seige, Duke Nukem, American McGee&#039;s Alice, Splinter Cell, and Deus Ex.</i>  Some of those have a chance of being good, but so did <i>Doom</i>, for crying out loud.</p>\r\n<p>One more thing, I&#039;m sick of these stupid movie games that just let you play every battle in the game.  <i>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</i>, and every <i>Lord of the Rings</i> game, for example.  I&#039;m not playing another game like that again, not that I did to begin with.  <i>Enter the Matrix</i> and <i>Path of Neo</i> are pretty much the same thing, just with guns and 'make everything impossible to control and see' buttons.  <i>Look, we can make a game look and feel just like a movie, except we&#039;ll throw in a bunch of extra levels that make no sense and don&#039;t contribute to the story at all.</i>  Fine, now make an actual game.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>7.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Improve your voice acting.</b></p>\r\n<p>Movies suck when they have bad actors in them, even if they are written and directed well.  Look at any Keanu Reeves movie.  Why would games be immune to bad acting?</p>\r\n<p>If people are just going to skip every cut scene to avoid the terrible voice work, just leave them out all together.</p>\r\n<p>The annoying thing is that the voice actor&#039;s union is fighting to get more money.  They must not be able to get payed much because they have such a hard time expressing their wishes.  They must have a hard time expressing anything, for that matter.</p>\r\n<p>It&#039;s also depressing to see bad screen actors turning into bad voice actors.  Keanu Reeves makes <i>Path of Neo</i> worse and worse every time he opens his unarticulated and semi-retarded mouth.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>8.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Leave big decisions up to the Player.</b></p>\r\n<p>It&#039;s what computer games are all about.  Games have far bigger emotional impact than movies because the Player is actually involved in the decisions.  Games today feel more like <i>Pac Man</i>, just weaving through tight corridors with only two ways to go, forward and backward.  We need more <i>Deus Ex</i> and <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, and less <i>Medal of Honor</i>.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>9.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Bad controls + terrible gameplay = waste of time and money.</b></p>\r\n<p>'IF NEO PUNCHES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR TO GOD . . . ' is something that shouldn&#039;t have to be said during a game.</p>\r\n<p>The gun combat in <i>PoN</i> makes me want to shoot myself because the controls are so terrible.  Neo never shoots in the direction he is pointing, or in the direction the cursor is aiming.  You would think that he would shoot in one of those two directions.  The camera is in such an akward place, and the perspective is so bad that it just makes it worse.  I can never tell what&#039;s going on, so I just randomly hit buttons and move around until the combat is over.  When you get moves off on enemies, like jumping on them or whatever, it&#039;s only satisfying because you finally got the paticular combination of keys correct.  The only reason I haven&#039;t shot myself yet is because I&#039;m afraid that using a gun is actually like that.</p>\r\n<p>WASD + Mouse is a good standard.  Considering how often games come out that have half decent controls, it&#039;s so suprising that games still come out that are impossible to control.  Sticking to standards like that leads me to the last one. . .</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>10.</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><b>Develop standards, while avoiding standards.</b></p>\r\n<p>This is a tough one, but not really that tough if you play games on a semi regular basis.  Things like WASD and the general layout of the HUD is pretty standard now.  There is no reason why control response or the user interface are as terrible as they are in some games.  Standards can help you get past simple things, so that you can move on to develop the more important things, like the 'make everything impossible to control and see' button.  There is no reason to reinvent the wheel.</p>\r\n<p>However, standards can really ruin a game.  <i>Quake 4</i> was so extremely boring because I&#039;ve played that game hundreds of times already.  Certain standards like 'enter room, spawn enemies, destroy enemies, give health / ammo, repeat' need to end.  When games like <i>The Sims</i> or <i>Black and White</i> come out that completely redefine everything, they are applauded and succeed.  That sort of innovation needs to continue.  I&#039;m all for denying conformity, after all.  But keep in mind that games like <i>Enter the Matrix</i> and <i>Daikatana</i> are hated because they refuse to follow the simple pattern that gamers are used to, like playability.</p>\r\n<p>It&#039;s a fine line, but it shouldn&#039;t be that hard for <i>computer science and math experts</i>.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s just what I think.  As always, I&#039;m open to your comments / additions / criticism.</p>",

I love it when I could have taken my final a year ago and still gotten an A on it.</p>\r\n<p>I&#039;m not looking forward to the other two tests today.  If another person tells me that I could have rescheduled them, I&#039;ll go insane.  I am completely aware that if you have more than 2 tests on a single day you can reschedule one of them.  I just didn&#039;t want to, because I don&#039;t really care.  I like being able to take care of all of my tests in a big chunk.  I&#039;ll be sure to post after The Economics and the Raster Imaging tests to let you all know how T-Day turned out.</p>\r\n<p>One bonus of having to get up so early for the stupid test:  being albe to blast my music at 9 in the morning and hoping that all of the morons in my hall are really annoyed by it.  It&#039;s revenge for everyone who was yelling and screaming last night when I was trying to sleep, or for everyone who was yelling and screaming while I was trying to study, or for everyone who was yelling and screaming while I was trying to sit here without people yelling and screaming.  There is far too much yelling and screaming in this hall.</p>\r\n<p>For anyone who didn&#039;t find those two questions quite as easy as I did, it&#039;s fine.  They are both just really easy programming questions.  The first one is dealing with modulus (%) which takes two numbers and returns the remainder after deviding them.  It&#039;s one of the simplest concepts in programming, and it basically means that a lot of the test was just simple elementary school math.  The second question is slightly more complicated, but it&#039;s still insanely easy.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

Everyone who is selected picks a <b>partner</b> (it can be anyone) and then picks <b>two scenes</b> to do with that person and then <b>a monologue</b>.  After round one (which happened bright and early this morning), the more than <b>350</b> teams is thinned down to <b>35</b>.  Those <b>35</b> then do their scenes again, and one of them is selected to go to the <b>national competition</b>.  The winner of that competition wins a nice <b>$2,500 scholarship</b>.  Last year, the lovely and talented <b>Amanda Folena</b> (from right here at Purdue) went all the way and won the <b>national scholarship</b>.  So remember <b>that</b> next time you think Purdue&#039;s theatre department doesn&#039;t exist.  Here are <b>those</b> nominated from Purdue:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Caley Milliken</b>, from <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i>.</li>\r\n<li><b>Joe Quadres</b>, from <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i>.</li>\r\n<li><b>Andrew Carlson</b>, from <i>Arms and the Man</i></li>\r\n<li><b>Stacie Hadgikosti</b>, from <i>Arms and the Man</i></li>\r\n<li>Annelise Dickinson, from <i>His Occupation</i></li>\r\n<li>Alexander Floyd, from <i>His Occupation</i></li>\r\n<li>Lauren Sivak, from <i>Marisol</i></li>\r\n<li><b>Matthew Erickson</b>, from <i>Metamorphoses</i></li>\r\n<li>Suzanne Miller, from <i>Metamorphoses</i></li>\r\n<li>Lauren Briggeman, from <i>Road</i> (for those of you who saw <i>Road</i>, she was the angry Daughter who gave the speach near the end about everything being dirty)</li>\r\n<li>Peter Kremidas, from <i>Road</i> (again, for those of you who saw <i>Road</i>, he was the guy who starved himself)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An Impressive list, to be sure.  Five of them are grad students (the ones in <b>bold</b>), and the others are undergrad.  I have the honor of being the lovely and talented <b>Matthew Erickson</b>&#039;s partner.  It&#039;s a real <b>honor</b> to be chosen by him, because I&#039;ve seen him in several shows and I really look up to him.  We performed this <b>morning</b>, at about 11:40 (<b>Normal</b> time;  12:40 Lafayette time).  As it turns out, you can only do <b>one</b> scene of the two you selected for the first run, because there are so many groups.  <b>Matthew and I</b> did a scene from <i>Beggars in the House of Plenty</i> by John Patrick Shanley.  It went pretty <b>well</b>.  I was also able to see the lovely and talented <b>Andrew Carlson</b>&#039;s scene, the lovely and talented <b>Annelise Dickinson</b>&#039;s scene, and the lovely and talented <b>Caley Milliken</b>&#039;s scene.

They admit that it&#039;s not a great game, but they call it above average because it&#039;s all they get.  How can everyone just roll over and accept that filth?  As my friend Scott Shultz put it, '[<i>Path of Neo</i>] had lots of bugs and the gameplay was pretty bad, also the gun fighting was not to my satisfaction. But when I installed the game the only thing I was really looking for was some descent hand to hand combat and it following the movie fairly well. I got that and so I was happy enough to get past the bugs and gameplay(which by the way the combat is really not that bad once you get used to it).'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&#039;s statement sums up the entire game industry.

My real weakness is the games where we stand in a line and make jokes about something.  Last night we played <i>b movie</i>, in which we say 'I saw a bad movie about _ last night'  then everyone else says 'how bad was it?'  and we say 'it was so bad, _.'  I pretty much bombed that one.  I&#039;ve never been good with being on the spot, which is why I don&#039;t think I should really do improv, but it especially hurts in a game like <i>b movie</i> or <i>worlds worst</i>.  I&#039;ve always wanted to have a quick wit like my uncle Mike, up near Detroit.  He makes jokes all the time, and I think he would be perfect at improv games like that.  I try to make puns like that, but I usually can&#039;t think of anything.  Anyway, I don&#039;t really know how well it went.  This is pretty much my one chance to work with Peter before he leaves Purdue, and I would like to get in for that reason alone.  They said they would call in the next couple days if I made it.

I&#039;ve also tweaked the updates ticker on top of the screen, so it includes the News Quote<sup>tm</sup> changes now, and you can look at past quotes if you click the ticker when it has something about the quote on it.  As always, you can click on the ticker and it will take you to whatever it is referencing.

Here is one.</p>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><b>John Deely is a bastard.</b></dt>\r\n<dd>We had our first dress rehearsal for <i>The Winter&#039;s Tale</i> on Monday, but unfortunately I also had an exam for my Stat class.  <i>No worries</i>, I thought, <i>I&#039;ll just go in before the exam and ask when the makeup session is</i>.  Every exam I&#039;ve been to here at Purdue has had a makeup session, so that people in my position can take the test later when it is more convenient.  <i>The Winter&#039;s Tale</i> is an academic function, so it definitely has precedence over an exam, and I am allowed to take any conflicting exam later.  John Deely didn&#039;t think so.  John Deely is the 'professor' of my Stat class.  When I went in to tell him that I couldn&#039;t take the test (after having just walked from my room to Lynn hall and then to Matthews just to find the guy), he took me into the hallway and gave me a very well practiced and loud speech.  It would have been intimidating and a maybe even a little scary if he wasn&#039;t straining to look up so he could yell at my face.  He asked me if I thought this was High School.  He said that he thought we were more mature than that.  He apparently had something against me telling him that I couldn&#039;t take the test at the last minute.  I had every reason to turn it right back at him and chew him out for being an asshole, but I stroked the little man&#039;s ego, just to humor him.  I shut up and stared down at his bald spot (honestly, you can&#039;t intimidate a guy who&#039;s a good two feet taller than you, John).  I just went ahead and took the test, since it wasn&#039;t really necessary for me to be at the dress rehearsal right away anyway.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThanks to the glories of modern internet, I can tell the world what I wished I had said to John Deely.  Here&#039;s what I really wanted to say to him:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<i>Ok, listen up, buddy.</i> (take step forward, really emphasising the height) <i>You have absolutely no right to talk to me like that.  Quite a bit of money exchanged hands so that I could go here, so I&#039;m not doing this for your benefit.  I pay you, pal.  The money you spend on your comeover comes straight from my tuition, little man, so you better respect me.  I came in here with every bit of respect for you, and I respectfully asked you to make up the test, and you think you have the right to yell at my face?  I can&#039;t take this test because I have an academic function which I am contractually obliged to attend.  You&#039;re going to let me make up this test tomorrow, or I&#039;m going to get the dean in here to explain it to you further.  You talk to me about maturity?  You think your class is so much more than high school?  Look, pal, you&#039;re teaching a bunch of Liberal Arts majors at an engineering school.  This test that people are taking is <b>open book, and open note</b>.  You&#039;re questioning my maturity, and you&#039;re teaching a class that has all open book exams?  You&#039;re absolutely right, pal, this is nothing like high school.  I never had anything this easy in high school.  I know you get off on yelling at students, and I&#039;m terribly sorry that I&#039;m not going to just bend over and let you go nuts, but nobody - especially nobody who&#039;s paid with my money - talks to me like that.  I&#039;ll see you tomorrow.</i> (Put badass sunglasses on and walk out)\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI had every right to say that to him, but I&#039;m kinda glad I didn&#039;t.  I just took the test and got it out of the way.\r\n<dd>\r\n\r\n\r\n</dl>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

The audience was mostly older people tonight, but there were some younger folks as well.  Richard Rand saw the show tonight, and he really enjoyed it.  Rich directed <i>Road</i>, which I was in last semester, and he&#039;s an amazing director to work with.  I felt really akward, though.  For some reason I feel like I&#039;m in a different show than everyone else.  I sit backstage and watch the show through the closed-circuit television, and then I go on for a couple minutes to say my lines.  Of course the only things people said to me tonight were mentioning how tall I looked in my costume.  That&#039;s really my only function.  My sole purpose is to look impressive.  I don&#039;t have to act.  I just have to be tall.  I can&#039;t really say that I&#039;m not excited to be able to use my only strong physical characteristic.  To be honest, I have been training for this my entire life.  I just feel sepparated from the rest of the cast for some reason.  It must just be me, because I felt this way about <i>Road</i>, too.  I do have fun, and I enjoy goofing around with everyone backstage.  I can&#039;t help but feel like the only reason I&#039;m there is because I am abnormally and freakishly tall, and they are exploiting the fact that people like to stare at me.  Other people talk about their lives, like what they&#039;ve done recently, or movies they like.  People only talk to me about how tall I am.  It&#039;s ok, though, beacause my life is pretty boring, so I wouldn&#039;t really have anything else to talk about anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s just really hard to describe how I am feeling.

      "text": "<p>Tuesday evening, at 5:30 PM, the cast of <i>The Winter&#039;s Tale</i> played the first official games for the Purdue Theatre Basketball League (PTBL).  We had 14 people show up, so we set up 3 teams.  Two of the teams had five people, and one had 4.  We commenced a four on four on four tournament.  I was on the four person team, with my Li&#039;l Chum and Stevie Chaddock.  We also had a guy who was a friend of one of the cast.  I don&#039;t know where this guy came from, but I sure was glad he was on our team.  Even though we had one less player than the rest of the teams, we still held our own.  The first game we played we lost, but then after recouperating and watching our two competitors play, we performed much better.  We beat both teams, and then beat the first one again for the hell of it.  We are therefore the ultimate PTBL champions.  It feels very good to be on top, even though many of my muscles don&#039;t.  The next game is next Tuesday at 5:30, so we&#039;ll have to defend our title then.  I don&#039;t think it will be very hard, considering we are champions.</p>\r\n<p>Also, I made my first slam dunk on Tuesday, which is pretty exciting.  Ok, so it was more of a lay-up where I touched the rim, but it went in.  I&#039;ll keep working, and soon I&#039;ll be a slam dunk champion, too.  I sure have more dunks on my record than anyone else in the PTBL.  I&#039;m starting to see why people always wonder if I play basketball.  I am pretty awesome.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>There are some pretty rediculous things going on right now.  Here&#039;s another one.</p>\r\n<p>I found an idiot.  It&#039;s really not that hard to find an idiot around here, but I&#039;m pretty proud of this one.  He&#039;s a <i>really</i> stupid one.  His name is Joey Marburger, and he is the assistant features editor for the Purdue <i>Exponent</i>.  This man (boy) is one of the primary reasons why the Purdue student newspaper is knicknamed the 'Excrement' by most of the students.  Here is Joey&#039;s column from Thursday, April 20<sup>th</sup>, entitled</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Excise proves freedom isn&#039;t free</p>\r\n\t\t\t<div style='width: 250px; margin: auto; font-family: times new roman; background-color: #cccccc; padding: 10px'>\r\n<b style='font-size: 40px'>Excise proves &#039;freedom isn&#039;t free&#039;</b>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve got a problem.  It runs in packs, costs hundreds of dollars and makes me sick.  Yes, I&#039;m talking about excise police.</p>\r\n<p>With the sexiest party day of the year upon us, these bounty hunters of the underage drinker will be out in full force to make sure you might not have a good time.  Now hold on, before this gets too intense, I must say that I respect local police and their efforts to provide security and make students safe.  But excise police just don&#039;t do it for me.</p>\r\n<p>I guess you can get a rush out of busting parties to which you weren&#039;t invited, writing tickets ruining someone&#039;s social life for quite some time, and making personal money off another&#039;s misery.  But is the safety for underage drinkers really the issue?  What if all minors quit drinking and there weren&#039;t any tickets to hand out anymore?  Well, poop.  I suppose excise would be out of a job and the crap ton of money they, and the fine state of Indiana, make.</p>\r\n<p>Really the issue is Indiana spends money on these guys to crawl around and bust kids while murderers and rapists roam the streets.  You know why?  Because busting hardcore criminals doesn&#039;t pay good money.  So please excise, if you care about people&#039;s safety, try being a real cop and make a difference.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, if you get on the Indiana Excise Police Web site (<a href='http://www.in.gov/atc/what.htm'>link</a>) you might notice the third purpose in their mission statement is 'to provide for the raising of revenue.'  That 'revenue' might go to education, or something beneficial for the state, but I&#039;m sure a good bit of it goes right to excise officers&#039; pockets.</p>\r\n<p>And for those who wish to party this weekend just remember from the fine creators of 'Team America World Police,' freedom isn&#039;t free.  It costs about $500 after court services.</p>\r\n<p><i>Joey Marburber is a junior in the College of Liberal Arts.  He believes he will be singled out for a P.I. this weekend due to this column.  He can be reached at features@purdueexponent.org.</i></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>That is exactly how the article appeared in the Excrement.  I don&#039;t know if I should even say anything about the article.  It really speaks for itself.  Joey Marburger is an idiot.  I wish I could get the picture he has next to this, because it is another good argument for his idiocy.  He has one of those emo haircuts, with hair covering his right eye.  He has a black shirt and a red striped tie.  His right arm is stretched forward, his thumb akwardly jutting upward at a strange angle.  The picture looks like it was taken a half second early, that he was in the middle of smiling and giving us all a 'thumbs-up.'  The picture looks like the camera man took it just a bit early, so poor Joey&#039;s smile hadn&#039;t really formed yet, and his thumb was stuck at that weird pergatory somewhere between the presidential thumb&#039;s up gesture and the thing a painter does to measure his subject.  The picture looks like it was captured at an akward time, but I bet Joey&#039;s just one of those people who always look like that.  His writing seems like it was taken just a bit too early, too, and if he had just let those thoughts develop a little bit more, he would have realized that it was such a terrible idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose I should at least elaborate on some of the things he&#039;s talking about.  The 'sexiest party day of the year' is referring to the fact that it is Grand Prix week, which is just a rediculous excuse for everyone on campus to be completely drunk all weekend.  Considering how much underaged drinking happens on a regular basis on campus, this week is most definitely a good time to bolster the police force.  As much as he hates the excise police, I can almost gaurantee that they won&#039;t to the job anywhere near well enough to curb the amount of alcohol abuse here.  Oh, and that link that he lists in his column (the link above is exactly what he listed) is not about excise police, it&#039;s just the Indiana State Alcohol and Tobacco Commision.  Providing for the raising of revenue is just talking about the fact that they give licenses to people to sell alcohol.  It has nothing to do with excise police at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy I hope he gets arrested this weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some day, this website will have a list of idiots who are drags on society and rediculous excuses for human beings.  John Deely and Joey Marburger will top that list.</p>\r\n",

His name is R.J.  He was pretty creepy, and a little too familiar with the house.  We think there was some bad business between him and the previous owner.  He helped out with some stuff, but he mostly just stood around and said random things.  I believe in this picture he was counting something in the downstairs bathroom.  Or maybe he was playing checkers on the wall.

      "text": "<p>I wish I could make an extended post mocking the lame news coverage of voting, but I don&#039;t have the time.  The 2006 Primaries were this past Tuesday, if some of you didn&#039;t notice.  I can understand if you weren&#039;t extremely excited about who your county commissioner, prosecutor, or sheriff is.  I&#039;m sure you&#039;re even less interested about who could possibly be running for those positions in the fall.  That&#039;s the really pointless thing about these primaries.  You&#039;re not voting for anything (with one exception, which I&#039;ll get to), you&#039;re just voting for who you want to vote for in November.  Plus, you have to pick a party and just vote for them, and in Hancock county (where I&#039;m from), only one party exists.  Hancock has voted Republican in every election since Lincoln.  That&#039;s a legacy we&#039;re not soon to give up.  As a result, you&#039;re stupid if you vote for any other party (I say that like it&#039;s a big choice, there&#039;s only one other party) in the primaries, because they will lose, without fail.  So, yes, I am sorry to say that I am currently classified as a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one important thing (and the only reason I went home during finals), was the school board race.  People might remember my long post about Dr. Riggs and his crazy construction plan (<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00027'>go ahead and click anywhere between these parentheses to read that post</a>).  His crazy construction plan was turned down by the public, thankfully, but we need people in the board to tell him that he&#039;s an idiot and stop him before he does anything else really stupid.  My mom was the campaign manager for a candidate who promises to do just that.  These two guys, David Bush and Shelton Oakes ran for school board with the local taxpayers in mind.  The board needed two new members.  Shelton Oakes was elected, but David Bush unfortunately came in third place.  A lady (the only woman running) got the first seat.  I will avoid getting into the politics of it all, but needless to say we&#039;re somewhat upset that Bush didn&#039;t get elected.  We&#039;re almost as upset as when that other Bush <i>was</i> elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I stood with my Mom outside one of the voting places to hand out buttons and tell everyone that David Bush and Shelton Oakes would appreciate their vote.  I believe that&#039;s called Electioneering.  In total, about 250 people showed up at the Fortville Boys and Girl&#039;s club to vote.  That&#039;s out of about 1200 registered voters who were supposed to go there, and that&#039;s about of about twice that many eligible adults in that part of Fortville.  That makes it about a 10% turn out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I voted at my old high school (going back to that place was a very tramatic experience).  I was number 194, and I voted at about 1:30.  The poles were open at 6:00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It just really gets me that so few people care.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Some pictures</p>\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan=1 valign=center>\r\n<p>This sign sat outside the door of the Boy&#039;s and Girl&#039;s Club.  Fifty feet was judged to be about the doorway, so as long as we stayed outside the building we were fine.  It&#039;s crazy that it is a felony to electioneer.  Imagine being convicted, and never being able to vote again, just for the two or so people who were ever in the place at one time.</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/vote06/vote01.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan=1 valign=center>\r\n<p>They don&#039;t like <i>Electioneering</i>.  <i>Subterranean Homesick Alien</i>, and <i>Karma Police</i> are fine.</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/vote06/vote02.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan=1 valign=center>\r\n<p>Budd Gray showed up and hung out for a while.

Budd got by far the most votes (because he had by far the most money, that&#039;s how democracy works), so he will be sheriff in the fall.  I say he will be sheriff, even though he&#039;s just the Republican candidate, because nobody is going to vote for the Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/vote06/vote03.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan=1 valign=center>\r\n<p>The judge came out a couple times to make sure we were playing the right Radiohead songs.</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td><img src=../assets/images/vote06/votejudge.jpg /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan=1 valign=center>\r\n<p>Budd Gray is a pretty big guy.

Here it is for your viewing pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This column was written by Peter Kremidas, and is his intellectual property.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Guest Column</p>\r\n\t\t\t<div style='text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px'><img src=../assets/images/guests/peter2.jpg />\r\n<br />\r\nby Peter Kremidas</div>\t\r\n\r\n<p>I have to write my thoughts down by hand, with a pen and paper. It slows me down, let’s the ideas form themselves and become concrete. I’m sitting in village coffee shop, about 4 hours before the second to last exam I will ever take. There is a ceiling fan right below a ceiling light, so the light is pulsing like kitten’s quickly beating heart on my paper. There is bad music in the background. It sounds like sad John Mayer. So it must be John Mayer, or Coldplay.</p>\r\n\t<p>Conversations about people’s problems and upcoming tests appear and disappear at random, fading in and out with the ‘Ts’ and ‘Ss’ cutting the short silences with the most clarity. The words don’t even register in my mind. These are only sounds humans make; it’s best not to try and make sense of them.</p>\r\n\t<p>The occasional clinking of silverware, turn of a paper, and other various clicks, movements, and sounds of friction come in and out and complete the message that there is life here.</p>\r\n\t<p>All these people are just like me. We have our whole lives ahead of us, and we don’t even know it. We can’t know it. When I think about how much my current decisions really effect the rest of my life, my handwriting suddenly gets small and nervous, and I don’t want to do anything so that I can stay safe and mistake-less. It’s a pressure that nobody isn’t aware of, but everybody ignores. Maybe that explains the escapism. Maybe early twenty-somethings drink as much as they do in order to make that pressure go away. If not drink, we all have our own brand of escapism. Video games, TV, movies, the internet, art, masturbation on an epic scale, whatever dips your proverbial chip.</p>\r\n\t<p>Imagine going through every day fully realizing just what the fuck you’re doing with your life here. It’s no wonder that we periodically act as if our actions had no consequences. After all, we’re on the edge here, right between childhood and adulthood. It’s no wonder that college is one part cerebral boot camp, and another part playground for big kids. Most of us just aren’t grown up enough yet to live in a world full of consequences.</p>\r\n\t<p>I was…well, still am among those lacking the strength to completely accept the world as it is. And it’s high time I learned. My mode of escapism was the same as most people’s. I drank, I did drugs. But, unlike others, I picked another poison as well. I picked comedy. I was picked by the crazy monkeys. And now I’m graduating and it’s time to go on to what my dad calls “bigger and better things.”</p>\r\n\t<p>Being as analytical as I am, I can’t help but think about this supposed “bigger and better” world. I think about it, and I have had by far the best times of my life here. I have laughed the hardest, loved the most, danced the hardest, accomplished the things I am most proud of, made my best friends, learned the most, and done it all more here than anywhere else. Ever.</p>\r\n\t<p>But there was another side to this. My worst times happened here, too. There were many times when I didn’t think I would ever get better, that I would never be happy again. There were times I cried so hard that I left stains in cold pavement. I hurt more here than anywhere else, and I’ve got the scars to prove it. And by the way, if you think all that was over one woman, you’re giving her way too much credit.</p>\r\n\t<p>And all through it all, I stood on a stage with some “Crazy Monkeys,” with all these life long friends that have come and gone through the years.</p>\r\n\t<p>And we laughed.</p>\r\n\t<p>We laughed no matter what.</p>\r\n\t<p>And so, when my dad talks about things getting “bigger” and “better” for me, I think he’s right. I think things will get bigger for me. I really do. But I don’t think they’ll ever get any better than this.</p>\r\n\t<p>Thanks so much, and goodbye.</p>\r\n\t<p>I’d better get back to studying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: right; font-weight: bold'>-Peter Kremidas, May 5th, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p><i>Peter Kremidas is a graduating senior at Purdue University.

I&#039;m telling you, though, it&#039;s important, and you need to see just how much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my opinion that Al Gore would have been the igreatest president of all time, were he elected in 2000 (or had the republicans not stolen the election, however the case might be).  He has an extremely important message.  It&#039;s very disappointing that people today are so controlled by politics that they refuse to see his message.  Please, for your own sake, look past your blind devotion for just 100 minutes and listen to what he has to say.  If you don&#039;t, there is a very good chance that hundreds of millions of people will die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, out now in theatres across the country.

It was just down the street from my aunt&#039;s house.  An interesting thing about this area is that many of the signs are lacking the cross street, like this one.  If someone was driving along Hawley Gibson Road, and they came to this street, how do they know what it is called?  Well, the name of the street pictured here is actually...</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/louisville_signs/oldfloyds.jpg' />\r\n<p>...Old Floydsburg Road, which is not to be confused with...</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/louisville_signs/floyd.jpg' />\r\n<p>. . . Regular Floydsburg Road.  Floydsburg and Old Floydsburg actually intersect, but unfortunately there are no road signs at the intersection.  It really makes you wonder, though.

Five hundred feet down this road, there is another sign saying 'Road Work 500 Feet.'  Four hundred feet from that sign is a sign that says 'Road Work 100 Feet.'  And then one hundred feet from that sign is nothing.  Roadwork signs clutter the streets, but there no actual road work happening anywhere.  I wish I could have gotten a picture looking down a hill where you can see roadwork signs every hundred feet.  Almost as frequent as these signs are signs that say 'end roadwork.'  They seem more like a political campaign than a road construction warning.  Judging from how much road work is actually happening on these roads, the campaign seems to have been a success.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<b class='center'>Interstate Signs</b>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/louisville_signs/ends.jpg' />\r\n<p>Gene Snyder Freeway Ends In Kentucky.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/louisville_signs/zorn2.jpg' />\r\n<p>NO, not Zorn!

You learn that the champion orchestral troupe has kidnapped you because their star violinist has taken ill and you are the only person who can keep him from riding the bullet train to deadsville.  Are you morally obligated to stay until the violinist gets better, or are you ethically justified in giving them all a big 'screw you' and leaving?  Welcome to Ethics 101.</dd>\r\n<dt><b>Voice for the actor</b></dt>\r\n<dd>The most attractive of the Purdue theatre grad students teaches me how to properly use my voice(s).  At the end of last year, she and a few other grad students mentioned that I have a really good voice, so I quickly signed on for this course.  I now see that it was just a ploy to help her meet her quota.</dd>\r\n<dt><b>Stage Combat</b></dt>\r\n<dd>Richard Stockton Rand, the professor I am creating a web site for, is a pretty amazing little man.  In this class, I learn how to beat the crap out of someone without actually touching them.  Later, I will learn how to swordfight, and perhaps eventually broadswordfight.  Rich is teaching me mental and physical discipline, which right now translates to extreme muscle fatigue.  I am sore in places I didn&#039;t know I had muscles.  Perks:  a really gorgeous, over-six-foot-tall volleyball player named Alex.  Cons:  always being paired up with her and realizing that she is quite a bit more physically fit than I am.</dd>\r\n<dt><b>Acting Workshop III</b></dt>\r\n<dd>The heroes from <i>Acting Workshop II: Curse of the Meisner-Monster</i> meet up once again, but this time, it&#039;s personal.  The evil Zorn Avenue is going to destroy the world, and only the performance of classic American and European realism will stop it.  Zorn&#039;s weakness  is Henrik Ibsen, as it turns out.</dd>\r\n<dt><b>Intro to Lighting technology</b></dt>\r\n<dd>We all have to sign up to work on lights for a paticular show taking place this semester.  I signed up for the winter dance show, hoping to get a chance to hang out with some scantily clad dancers, and impress them with my mental and physical discipline.  It probably won&#039;t happen, but a guy can dream.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a pretty light schedule, but I also have a job this semester (don&#039;t ask me what it is; I have no idea, to be honest).  I&#039;m somewhat glad I don&#039;t have more, because after just the third day, I&#039;m exhausted.  If that Stage Combat class doesn&#039;t have me toned and fit by the end of the semester, it can&#039;t be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other news, I finished my first draft of my screenplay.  Now all I have to do is pick up everything and move to LA.  I&#039;ve sent a few copies to a few of my peers, and the initial reactions seem to be positive.  Stay tuned to see how this works out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first Crazy Monkeys show will be Friday, September 8, at 8:00.  It will be at the Village Coffee house, and it will be free.

I will recount my misnamed misadventures here, so that everyone can find entertainment in other people&#039;s confusion.\r\n\t\t\t<p><b>Part I, In which Shauvon glazes over twelve whole years of his life</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to my mother, she who named me, my name means 'Night Hawk' in Gaelic.  When she was very pregnant with me (I was 12.5 pounds when I was born, so she was <i>very</i> pregnant), she had a dream.  In my mother&#039;s dream, she was standing outside at night.  A hawk appeared, flew toward her, landed in her arms, and turned into a baby.  That baby was me.  Anyway, that&#039;s how I got my crazy name.  The name that would haunt so many teachers.  My mom told me recently that it&#039;s a combination of Shawn and Steven, and she&#039;s correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most commonly used name I receive is 'Shuvon,' with the emphasis on the second syllable.  Shove on is not the correct way to pronounce my name.  It&#039;s the correct way to move one large thing so that it is on top of something else.  I actually met a girl at Purdue last year whose name is Shavonne.  Her name <i>is</i> pronounced 'Shuv-ON.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One time I got a detention slip with the name 'Shavin' on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in seventh grade, my gym teacher insisted on calling me shove on.  One time, when I was bored in his 'health class,' he called shove on to get a worksheet back.  I was sick of telling him that it&#039;s Shauvon, so I yelled 'IT&#039;S SHAUVON' and quickly grabbed the worksheet out of his hand.  He made me do ten pushups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only one teacher, in my entire 12 years of public school, was able to pronounce it correctly on the first try (that I remember).  I will name him for you now.  Mr. Chef, my fifth grade teacher, had just returned from vacation in Ireland, so he was familiar with Gaelic pronunciations.  I tip my hat to you, Mr. Chef.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess I should be happy that my high school diploma had my correct name on it.  It wouldn&#039;t suprise me at all, though, if those idiots at Mt. Vernon Community School Corporation had misspelled it.  Considering they did almost every single time they tried in the twelve years I was a student there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy reading the stories of my name misadventures as much as I enjoyed living them.  Well, I actually hope you don&#039;t enjoy it as much as I did.  I didn&#039;t enjoy it very much at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00147'>Continue to Part II of Shauron&#039;s Name Adventures</a>",

      "text": "\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><b>In which Shauvon is accepted to college, and visits a pulmonologist.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, I was accepted to Purdue University.  It was a pretty exciting moment in my life.  Well, not that exciting, I suppose, considering they accept somewhere around 50,000 new students every year.  That was before I realized I didn&#039;t really want to get a degree in Computer Graphics Technology, so I was getting a degree in Computer Graphics Technology.  I will always remember opening my acceptance letter.  They came one day when I was at school.  I say 'they' because there was, in fact, two letters addressed to my house.  One of them was for me, Shauvon G. McGill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other was addressed for Sauvon G. McGill</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a new one.  I&#039;ve had letters missing, changed, repeated, and mangled in my name before, but I&#039;d never had the &#039;h&#039; missing.  Of all the phonemes in the name Shauvon, the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative (&#039;sh&#039; as in &#039;wash&#039; or &#039;fish&#039;) is the easiest to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two acceptance letters were stapled together and taped to my bedroom door for quite some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later, the summer before my sophomore year of college, I had some lung problems, so I went to see a pulminologist.  That was still before I realized I didn&#039;t really want to get a degree in Computer Graphics Technology, so I was still getting a degree in Computer Graphics Technology.  That meant that I sat around all day working with computer graphics.  I was out of shape, and as  a result, my lungs weren&#039;t too excited about me jumping on my bike after lazing around all summer.  If I had known that I would be relieved of my bike in just a few months, I wouldn&#039;t have worried about it.  Anyway, the pulminologist had his receptionist set up appointments for several outpatient tests.  The receptionist was a rather, well, <i>dull</i> woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Ok, what&#039;s his name.'  She talked to my mom, like I was 9, and not 19, years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Shauvon,' my Mom said.  It&#039;s a combination of Shawn and Steven, she would tell me later that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The receptionist called in the first of the appointments.  'I need an echocardiogram for a &#039;Savron.&#039;'  She missed the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'No, it&#039;s &#039;Shauvon.&#039;  &#039;SHo-VIN&#039;'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Sha. . . SHA-VON'  That would have to do.  She called in the next one.  'I need a pulmonary function test for a &#039;Shalvo&#039;'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a moment in which my mom and I both tried not to laugh at this poor mentally challenged woman, we corrected her.  'It&#039;s Shauvon.  SHo-VIN!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I need an appointment with a heart specialist for a &#039;Shalvron&#039;'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It went on like this for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, after my Mom re-scheduled all of the appointments because nobody had the right name, I was able to have several specialists tell me that there was nothing wrong with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days later, we found out that the insurance company wasn&#039;t going to cover any of the tests.  They mentioned something about a Sauvon McGill not being on our plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They forgot the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative.</p>",

      "text": "<p>I recently upgraded to a digital SLR camera, the Canon EOS 350D (her friends call her Digital Rebel XT).  It is definitely a sweet piece of technology.  One of the greatest things about digital SLR cameras is the ability to record images as a digital negative, or Camera Raw format.  Basically, it stores as much data as possible, so that you can tweak almost everything later on a computer.  White balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, shadows and many more settings can all be manipulated later on.  It allows the photographer to worry more about the shot, and less about all of the technical nitty gritty.  Of course, you still have to deal with shutter speeds and aperture values, but that&#039;s what photography is.  I&#039;ll show you just how powerful Camera Raw format can be.  Also, I&#039;ll show off some sweet pictures I took with my new tripod.  They are some awesome shots.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>You&#039;re an awesome shot.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<div class='center'>\r\n\r\nShot one:  Long exposure street.\r\n<br />\r\nHere it is as I shot it, with generic white balance and exposure.  It looks ok.  I set up the tripod next to State Street and shot off a 20 second shutter speed.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules01.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is the shot, after I tweaked it in Photoshop using the camera raw plugin.  This isn&#039;t photoshopped, though, all I did to it was tweak the raw settings built into the image.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules02.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nShot two: horizon glow.\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a shot of the halo eminating from Battleground, I believe (a town just north of Lafayette).  This shot was taken from the footbridge crossing the Wabash.  \r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules03.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nNow after tweaking.  Primarily, all I did was adjust the white balance.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules04.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nShot three: under the bridge.\r\n<br />\r\nThe Wabash is running really low right now, so I could walk out onto the bank and get some nice shots of the State Street bridge.  \r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules05.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nAgain, the only major change was the white balance.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules06.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nShot four: under the bridge II.\r\n<br />\r\nI didn&#039;t get many good shots of the State Street bridge from the footbridge, but I got a few nice onces from the ground below.  \r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules07.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nAgain again, the only major change was the white balance.  I had a huge 'holy crap' moment when the sky popped out like this.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules08.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nShot five: under the bridge III.\r\n<br />\r\nI don&#039;t have enough shots with me in them, so I turned on the timer and ran out to be in this one.  \r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules09.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nI really like how the sky looks on these.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules10.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nShot six: State Street&#039;s crotch.\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the point where State street changes from two roads to one.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/rawrules/rawrules11.jpg' />\r\n<br />\r\nOur world is very yellow, it seems.

      "text": "<p>I need to buy my own food this semester.  I know that doesn&#039;t sound like much, but I&#039;ve never had to do it before.  In order to afford all of the Tang and pizza rolls, I&#039;ve gotten a job.  What does this mean to you?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Entertainment</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I&#039;m working for the ECN (Engineering Computer Network).  They have a website (<a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/'>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/</a>).  Part of this website is a 'Wall of Fame' (<a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Alumni/WallOfFame'>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Alumni/WallOfFame</a>), where they list all of the past graduates from Electrical and Computer Engineering.  It&#039;s essentially just a huge database of names and pictures.  I&#039;m working on that database.  Actually, the database is already made, I&#039;m just - well - I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m supposed to be doing.  All I know is I come here quietly for two hours every day, and they quietly put $150 or so into my checking account every other week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am working, though, so it&#039;s not like I just come here and do nothing (it&#039;s almost nothing).  On my first day, my boss told me that I would have to figure out how to work with the database.  She didn&#039;t mention that I would also have to figure out what exactly I&#039;m supposed to do.  At this point, I still don&#039;t know what I was hired for.  On one of my first days, I was just exploring around the site, seeing what it was all about (I&#039;ll save you some time and tell you it&#039;s not really about anything).  I noticed as I looked through the listings that the lists of graduates (broken up by year) that show up on the website are different than the actual lists in the database.  Many, and some times many many people are missing from the list.  That&#039;s a problem, and it probably results from the fact that nobody who does anything actually knows what they&#039;re doing.  The upshot is that it creates a new industry of people who&#039;s purpose is to redo everything everyone does.  This of course applies to anybody anywhere in the world, not just people who create extremely faulty databases for extremely seldom-visited websites.  Maybe my job falls into the second category, maybe it falls into the first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found out that all I have to do to fix the database is go to each offending record (the people who don&#039;t show up), and click 'update.'  That&#039;s right.  For the last several weeks, I&#039;ve been going to hundreds if not thousands of pages to edit individual graduates and clicking a single button.  Early years were easy, because only a handful of people graduated from Purdue those years.  However, the 90&#039;s had hundreds of graduates each year.  For the later years, I have to look at the list on the website with the list in the database and find each and every guy who is in one but not the other, and then click a button.  How exciting my job is!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/ECN01.gif' class='center' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The list of graduates from the year 1900.</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/ECN02.gif' class='center' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The list of graduates from the year 1990.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is pretty mindless, as I&#039;m sure you can guess.  I usually occupy myself with episodes of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> on my Creative Zen Vision:M.  One time I watched <i>Blade 2</i> while I clicked that little 'update' button several hundred times.  Sometimes I only work for an hour, but I write two onto my time card.  I don&#039;t think I even need to go in on Fridays at all, because nobody else does.  I really feel like George from that one episode of Seinfeld, where he never does any work, but just makes it look like he is always really busy.  I think most of the episodes of Seinfeld were about George not working, now that I think about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My boss is an interesting character, and I&#039;m still trying to decide if she creeps me out or if she&#039;s just eccentric.  I&#039;m leaning toward the latter, frankly.  I don&#039;t think she cares that I don&#039;t really have anything to do, it&#039;s not her money that&#039;s being quietly deposited in my account every other week.  She has to know that this website gets maybe five hits a year, and that it&#039;s such a huge piece of junk it needs to be completely rebuilt.  All I know is that she wears some pretty rediculous outfits, things that I could never hope to put into words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long story short, I have no attachment to this job whatsoever.  If I was fired (because they realize that I&#039;m completely unecessary), I could get a hundred more little bean counter jobs like this one in a week.  I therefore have no qualms about being one of the worst employees this world has ever seen.  Take right now, for instance.  My boss told me that she wasn&#039;t going to be here all week.  That gives me an interesting challenge.  The challenge is to do as little work as possible, while still making it look like I&#039;m not just watching <i>Curb your Enthusiasm</i> for two hours.  Right now, for example, I&#039;m making a long post to my website about it.  If it wasn&#039;t for the random people who occasionally walk by and can verify that I didn&#039;t show up, I probably wouldn&#039;t even come in at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m getting very close to the end of the database.  I&#039;m almost out of years to fix.  I don&#039;t want to get there, because it means I have to find something else to do.  That, my friends, is not an easy task.  I think my boss mentioned something about pictures . . . ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so now we get to the upshot for you, tonight&#039;s loyal fans.  As I go through each and every student who got an Electrical Engineering degree at Purdue, I run across some semi-interesting names.  For example,</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/picture01.gif' class='center' /><div class='caption'>This one isn&#039;t so great, I just think it&#039;s an interesting name.  Plus, I have to love the name Tang.</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/picture02.gif' class='center' /><div class='caption'>Eric is a lame and unworthy name for a Schwinghammer.</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/picture03.gif' class='center' /><div class='caption'>Oh Yoshimi, they don&#039;t believe me, but you won&#039;t let those robots defeat me.</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/picture04.gif' class='center' /><div class='caption'>I don&#039;t care what James Michael told you, because James Michael Lies!</div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/ECN/picture05.gif' class='center' /><div class='caption'>Are you Charles?

One perk about my job is that there&#039;s a webcam pointed directly at the place I park my bike.  So if you&#039;re really bored you can take a look and see if I&#039;m here pretending to work.  If you see the giant blue and sliver bike, it&#039;s probably mine. If you&#039;re lucky (and watching at half past the hour), you might just see me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/WebCam/cam06/index'>Click here, and then click on the big picture to see the live footage.</a>",

      "text": "<p>I&#039;m in Purdue&#039;s production of <i>Richard III</i>, and I need to submit a bio for the program or whatever.  If anyone out there isn&#039;t familiar with bios, they&#039;re stupid and pointless little paragraphs that people write about themselves.  I despise them for several reasons.  They always feel like I&#039;m showing off, I don&#039;t like writing something so mundane, and I never know what to say.  I&#039;m supposed to turn a bio in today, so I&#039;m going to see what I can do.  Humor me, if you will, and I will try a few things out here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the classic, boring, stupid, meaningless, informative bio.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Shauvon McGill is a Junior majoring in theatre.  This is his second semester in the department, and his third production at Purdue.  Shauvon came to Purdue to study computer graphics technology, but he switched to theatre because he prefers the security of modern professional theatre.  Shauvon wants to thank his parents, his friend Scott, his role model Rob Cockerham, and of course, Ina Garten.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Boring.  Let&#039;s spice it up a little bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Shauvon McGill is and always has been composed entirely of a new type of spatial plasma which has yet to be discovered by the scientific community.  Many years ago, several stars collided in deep space.  The mass of the two stars collected together, creating this new substance and launching it at the planet Earth.  The mass landed on the surface of the planet and cooled to form the body of Shauvon McGill.  A reclusive mad scientist found the lifeless body and took it to his lab to study.  A few years later, the mad scientist was working on an experiment when something went terribly wrong.  The scientist was killed, but his mind was mysteriously transported to the plasma body.  He gave up his scientific career and decided to study theatre at Purdue University.  This is his third show.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Much more interesting, no?  A couple weeks ago, I wrote a bio for Andrew Preston (I&#039;m much more comfortable writing bios about someone besides me) for the <a href='http://www.thecrazymonkeys.com'>Crazy Monkeys website</a>.  It turned out pretty sweet.  I could just steal that back and change his name to mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Many years ago, for a brief moment in time, the universe was perfectly aligned to a particular position that only occurs once every two hundred million billion years.  Scientists call this event the cosmic rocking, and it is a phenomena that most humans were completely unaware of.  In fact, only a select few even know that the cosmic event exists.  However, that cosmic event is the most important thing that will ever happen.  At that precise moment, almost twenty five years ago, at the instantaneous event when every single body in the entire universe was perfectly aligned, a baby was born on a small planet in the Milky Way Galaxy.  That planet was Earth.  Some believe that the baby was imbued with the energies of the entire universe, and some say that it was an emissary sent from the gods to teach us to be at peace with one another.  Whatever the case, everyone knew that this child was special.  The child soon found powers beyond those of any normal human.  Soon, the child advanced beyond every other child, every teacher, and even those considered to be superior human beings.  Scientists from all over the planet came to study this being, and discover what gave it these amazing powers.  Not a single human being could discover what caused this creature to be so superior.  All of the knowledge, the documentation, and the studies meant nothing.  All of human logic was useless.  The being&#039;s powers were beyond even human imagination, which was always thought to be infinite in its abilities.  This being could rock.  It rocked hard, and it rocked fast.  The being could rock harder and faster than anything that ever existed in the history of the universe.  The world was stunned, for the universe had created the ultimate being.  This being is the pinnacle of existence.  This being is Shauvon McGill.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><b>They</b> probably won&#039;t let me submit that, though.  It&#039;s too 'out there' for them.  What a bunch of prudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if I submit a bio that is written about the future instead of the past?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Shauvon McGill will graduate from Purdue University in three years.  After failing to do anything with his theatre degree, he will spend six years living in his parent&#039;s house, playing computer games and completing freelance web design projects to pay for more computer games.  At the age of 29, Shauvon will finally meet the girl of his dreams, and move out of his parents house.  Shauvon will spend the next six years moving around the world with his girlfriend, who is a competitive pole-vaulter.  Shauvon will then be contacted by an old friend of his who needs a writer for a sketch comedy show.  Shauvon will spend the next twenty seven years writing sketch comedy and eventually comedic films.  Shauvon wants to thank his parents, his friend Scott, and of course, Ina Garten.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m just not feeling very attached to any of these.  Here is what I am going to do.  The other night, my friend Lauren Sivak had a dream that she submitted her bio, and the department changed it to 'Cast, beer, friends, life.'  She was upset, because she doesn&#039;t even drink beer.  The graduate students told her that they can change her bio however they want, and she can&#039;t do anything about it.  Finally, she saw me.  I was upset about my bio, as well.  The department simply changed mine to:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rivargo . . . ?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s short, it&#039;s sweet, it&#039;s mysterious.  There&#039;s no way they will let me use it, but it&#039;s worth a shot.  It will make my year if they put that in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wish me luck.</p>",

Although the ability to quickly find up is a good thing to have when driving in your car, the presence of a large plywood coffin is not.  'So, why <i>do</i> you have a coffin in your car?'  I asked again.  I&#039;m pretty sure the emphasis on the word &#039;do&#039; worked exactly the way I hoped, because it let <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> know that I meant business.  He told me what happened.  I don&#039;t think he was lying, because if he was, he would have come up with a much better story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had apparently been driving home from work and noticed this large wooden crate sitting in the alley behind the coffee shop where he works, quietly letting passers by know which way was up.  He didn&#039;t even think twice about it because <b>when you see a wooden crate in an alley behind the coffee shop where you work you can&#039;t waste any time thinking about what you would do with it just pick it up and come up with something later.</b>  A simmilar thing happened to us when we saw a 'One Way' sign laying in the grass behind Jimmy Johns.  <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> didn&#039;t have his car at the time, and we didn&#039;t want to walk down State Street holding a 'One Way' sign.  I wish we had gotten it, because then we could start a collection of things that point out other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/box.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Later, <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> would use the box to stand in.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>For those of you wondering when we would get to the gypsy&#039;s organ, your time has come at last.</b>  Three fourths of the way to the Goodwill store, we had to stop at a stoplight behind a few other vehicles.  <i>Act of fate A: if we had been just a few minutes earlier or later, we wouldn&#039;t have been stopped where we were, and the following would not have happened.</i>  I looked to my right, and I saw a house.  The sign in front said, 'ESP Readings: Open.'    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Do you want to get an ESP reading?' I asked <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'What?' He responded, confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Do you want a sweet organ?' I asked <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'What?' He responded, amazed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For you see, in front of the ESP lady&#039;s house sat a sweet organ.  It was big, it was made of wood, and it had two rows of keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Look at that sweet organ.' I suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Woah, that <i>is</i> a sweet organ.' He confirmed.  His emphasis of the word 'is' showed that he meant business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traffic moved ahead of us, and we had to leave the organ behind, for the moment.  We discussed the possibilities of purchasing the organ, and we debated the reason for the organ&#039;s exterior home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'The fact that it&#039;s sitting outside shows that it&#039;s for sale, right?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'You would think so, but there was no sign.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Well, the fact that there is no sign could mean that it&#039;s free.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I hate it when people say that.  Just because there is no sign doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s free.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I wasn&#039;t saying that, I was honestly wondering.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I don&#039;t know, maybe it&#039;s just sitting there.  It was back away from the sidewalk, so it might just live there.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Well, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to go in and inquire.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I don&#039;t even know how to play keyboard instruments.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This is a perfect opportunity to learn.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had arrived at Goodwill.  Shopping at Goodwill is always a suprise.  You never know what you&#039;re going to get.  I ended up finding a weird felt clock, a new swiss army knife to keep in my pocket, and two Lego sets (I know the risks involved with buying used Lego sets, but I thought it was worth it).  <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> got a couple spatulas, an ice cream scoop, and two crazy lightbulbs.  This next part is pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> checked out ahead of me.  As he walked up to the counter, the very cute girl standing behind the register commented on <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a>&#039;s shirt (it was a Velvet Underground tshirt).  The connection was made.  Andrew looked at me and gave me a less than subtle wink.  It turns out that the girl was a senior in high school, which quickly scared <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> away.  He promptly toned down the flirting.  We thought about buying a wheelchair, but when they told us it wasn&#039;t for sale, we decided against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s when <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> got some balls.  They were made of brass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went out to <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a>&#039;s car.  <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> wrote his phone number on the back of a savings deposit slip.  He went back inside the store for a few minutes.  I used the time to look at the pamphlet that came with my new pocket knife explaining all of the features my knife doesn&#039;t have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> told me later that the girl said, 'were you talking about the Big Lebowski earlier?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>I forgot to mention that we were talking about the </i>Big Lebowski<i> earlier.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'yeah, we&#039;re having a Big Lebowski party tomorrow night if you wanted to come . . .'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allow me to bold the words which paticularly stabbed <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> in the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I don&#039;t know.  I&#039;m working here all weekend and it&#039;s my <b>one year anniversary</b> with my <b>boyfriend</b>.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least he tried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out to explore the Goodwill store on the other-other side of town.  We were talking about the girl we met at the first Goodwill store so much that we almost forgot about the organ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Did you forget about the organ?' I asked.  If <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> could have done a screeching U-turn right then and there, he would have.  He may have failed at getting a girl, but he would succeed at getting an organ.  Off we sped to the gypsy lady&#039;s house.  <i>Act of fate B:  If I hadn&#039;t remembered about it, we would never have gotten it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We inspected the device, just to make sure it was something we really wanted.  The problem is that this was never a thing we really wanted.  We overcame that problem and went inside to inquire.  Inquire we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gypsy lady was sitting in a chair, apparently somewhat crippled, with various medical supplies scattered around her.  She had a cast on her leg.  I wonder if she saw that injury coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'The asking price is fourty dollars.'  We had a hard time hearing her, because she had a few obnoxious dogs that kept barking.  'Everything works perfectly.'  Usually when people say 'everything works perfectly' something probably doesn&#039;t work perfectly.  That was something I learned on this adventure.  We couldn&#039;t get it immediately, because <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> didn&#039;t have fourty dollars cash, and his car was full of coffin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I had to go, so I wasn&#039;t with <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/gordonjingers' class='black'>Andrew</a> when he made the purchase.  Simmilarly, I have to go now, so I&#039;ll continue the story in a little bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00153'>Read part 2 of <i>The Curse of the Gypsy&#039;s Organ</i></a>",

Andrew Monkey said to me at about 11 Saturday morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'That&#039;s the second time someone has asked me to unload an organ today.' I responded.  'And the first time involving a car.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I left him the night before, Andrew unloaded his coffin, got some cash and went back to the gypsy&#039;s house.  He only had fifties, so he asked for ten dollars back.  If you remember, the gypsy said, 'the asking price is fourty dollars.'  Well, when Andrew asked for the ten dollars in change, the gypsy said, 'the asking price is fifty dollars.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Eh, whatever.' Andrew said.  Fifty dollars is still a pretty great price for an organ in which &#039;everything works perfectly.&#039;  The gypsy&#039;s mexican helper helped Andrew load the organ into his car.  They didn&#039;t know which way was up, but they did the best they could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&#039;re back to 11 on Saturday morning.  'Ok, well, I&#039;m downstairs, so I&#039;m coming up to your apartment for pizza rolls.'  Andrew told me.  I put some pants on and started some pizza rolls.  The pizza rolls were good, and the pants too short.  I took a look at those lego sets I bought the day before.  That leads me to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>CONSEQUENCE NUMBER 1:  MISSING LEGO PIECES</b></p>\r\n<p>I expected to have some pieces missing.  After all, I bought a lego set at Goodwill.  I expected to get passed the second step of the instructions, though.  When  I was missing such a crucial piece, I knew my future looked grim.  The Lego set was not just missing a few pieces, it was unbuildable.  That was dissappointing.  Little did we know that it was only a small symptom of a larger problem.  We just blindly went off to his place to unload his new organ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew lives on the third floor of his building.  The organ weighed about 200 pounds.  Maybe some of you have lifted 200 pounds up two flights of stairs, and maybe you haven&#039;t.  If you ever get the chance to do it, <b>avoid it at all costs</b>.  We took 15 minutes pushing and pulling that thing up the stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a break half way through to plug it in and see if it worked.  We figured we should see if it did actually work before we lugged it all the way up the stairs.  If the gypsy lied to us, then all the work we did would be for nothing.  The building had a few outlets outside by the stairs, probably for just such an occurance, in case someone needed to test an organ before they take it upstairs.  Andrew tentatively plugged the cord into the outlet.  No explosion (good sign).  The power light came on (good sign).  Andrew tentatively pushed one of the keys.  No sounds (bad sign).  I pushed a lever, and the organ started playing a simple beat.  We smiled at each other, and took it the rest of the way up the stairs.  'It&#039;s probably just something I have to figure out.'  Andrew said.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/organfull.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n\r\n<p>The organ is a Lowrey Mardi Gras.  It has:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Levers to control the lower key volume, the beat volume, the bass volume, and the beat tempo.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A row of switches to select a beat pattern (two per switch!).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A row of switches to select the upper key instrument.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Switches to toggle the 'genie bass', 'magic swing bass', and 'magic chord system.'</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Switches to select the lower key instrument.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Switches to select the presets (we don&#039;t know what these do).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Levers to control the sustain, swing piano volume, and vibrato.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Buttons to toggle vibra trem flutes and flute celeste (whatever those are).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Thirteen foot pedals to control the bass.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A master volume pedal.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Two rows of piano keys.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A power switch.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all of those things, most of the piano keys don&#039;t work, and as a result, some of the switches don&#039;t seem to do anything.  The piano keys work some times, and sometimes they don&#039;t work.  The one exception to this is the mid-range &#039;B&#039; on the lower keyboard.  That baby works perfectly.  This leads me to think that it&#039;s fixable, and all it will take is an electrical engineering major (Scott) to get in there and solve the problem.  The keys that do work are pretty amazing, so if this thing is going at full capacity, it would be devastatingly awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only downside is the whole curse thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We removed the back panel, to see what the organ&#039;s organs looked like.  'You know, we did buy this from a gypsy.' I mused.  'There&#039;s a pretty good chance that it could be cursed.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At any rate, the organ&#039;s presence brought about many delicious organ related puns, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>'We just wanted to organize the place a little bit.</li>\r\n<li>'We should move it into your room, taking it along the organ trail.'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few hours playing around with it, it was adorned with all sorts of labels and stickers.  (actually, only two sorts: three labels and one sticker)  None of these things were on the organ when we got it.  Andrew had that weird egyptian sticker for a while, and he never knew what it meant.  We just knew it had to go on the organ.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/magickey.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/weirdsticker.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/lookoutcursed.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n\r\n<p>The most exciting part hasn&#039;t even come yet.  We&#039;ve already seen one effect of the curse, and many examples of fate&#039;s shadowy hand in these events.

Andrew asked me on Saturday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'That&#039;s the first time someone has asked me to go to a Halloween party,' I replied, 'and the second time I&#039;ll say yes.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had to wait for Andrew to get off work.  I went home to put a lousy costume together.  What our costumes were is not important, because as it turns out</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-size: 25px; color: red'>WE WOULDN&#039;T NEED THEM!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my way back to where Andrew works (the coffee shop in front of the alley where he found the coffin), a group of partially inebriated men stopped me and asked me where Chances Are was.  Chances Are is a show club on the far side of Lafayette, just past the Gypsy&#039;s house Andrew and I went to the day before.  I told the gentlemen that they were in very-much-the-wrong place, and they kindly asked me if I could take them there.  If I had held out a little longer, I probably could have gotten them to pay me.  <i>Act of Fate C: if I had shown the gentlemen where Chances Are was, perhaps the fateful events of Saturday night would not have happened quite the same way.</i>  Luckily (or unluckily), Andrew called me when the gentlemen were discussing this matter with me, so I had an easy excuse to get rid of them.  They went off down Chauncy hill, presumably walking to Chances Are.  I doubt they made it, because it&#039;s about fifteen minutes away from Chauncy Hill by car.  On slightly inebriated feet, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a much longer journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew called me and told me to meet him at the coffee shop.  We were going to meet at his car, but he forgot some things (like his wallet), so he had to go back for them.  <i>Act of Fate D:  if Andrew hadn&#039;t forgotten his wallet, we would have been just a few minutes earlier, and perhaps the fateful events of Saturday night would not have happened quite the same way.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew got his things and we left.  Some crazy guy was saying something about a missing box that he keeps in the alley.  I don&#039;t know what that was all about.  Eventually, Andrew and I got to his car.  Andrew drives a Subaru Outback station wagon.  It&#039;s a nice car.  It has enough room for a rather large coffin, or an average-sized Gypsy&#039;s organ, or five comfortable Crazy Monkeys.  It has cup-holders, an FM radio, power windows, and</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-size: 25px; color: red'>A SEVERE DESIGN FLAW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were driving out on 200 North.  Friends call it Lindberg Road.  That is the road that leads to Andrew&#039;s apartment.  It is also the road the leads to my Grandma&#039;s house.  Look it up on Google Maps on your own time.  We had just passed the Celery Bog, and I was about to note that the road was getting bumpier.  There is a particular stretch of Lindberg Road that goes over the Celery Bog which gets particularly bumpy (corrugated cardboard style).  They have rebuilt the road several times, but each time it just gets bumpy again (corrugated cardboard style).  We had just passed that particular stretch of Lindberg Road, and I was about to note that the road was getting bumpy yet again.  I made it through the following words before Andrew&#039;s window exploded:  hey, this, road, is, and getti.  &#039;Getti&#039; isn&#039;t actually a word.  I was trying to say &#039;getting,&#039; but I was cut short when Andrew&#039;s window exploded.  I usually mention something about that particular stretch of Lindberg Road whenever I ride on it, because it seems like every time I do, it gets bumpier and bumpier (corrugated cardboard style).  However, at this particular moment, certain events were slightly more important.  Right as I was about to speak the voiced velar nasal sound at the end of the word &#039;getting&#039;, Andrew&#039;s car made it&#039;s own voiced velar nasal.  Granted, Andrew&#039;s car lacks several key points of anatomy to properly emit a true voiced velar nasal, but it did what it could with what it had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a loud bang, followed by a loud pop, followed by the sound of millions of glass shards falling all over the back seat of Andrew&#039;s car, followed by the sound of Andrew and me experiencing simultaneous &#039;brown alerts.&#039;  By a show of hands, who here has been in a car when a window exploded?  Sometimes I forget that the internet isn&#039;t a lecture hall.  If you have experienced the spontaneous explosion of a car window, you know the horrible fear that consumes everyone in the car when such an event occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a short period during which various expletives were said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'That means someone is shooting at us, right?' Andrew asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is, of course, 'no, don&#039;t be ridiculous.'  However, the surging levels of adrenaline in my body caused me to say some form of the expression 'shit, I don&#039;t know, man, but I think so.'  We made it to Andrew&#039;s apartment, both of us ducking below the level of the dashboard, and we got out to survey the damage.  I had my camera, and took some pictures of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is where I&#039;ll put the bold text saying,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>CONSEQUENCE NUMBER 2: THE EXPLODING WINDOW</b></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/wondow1.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This doesn&#039;t do justice to how much broken glass was everywhere.  The door is actually full of it, so every time we closed it, it rattled in a rather comical way.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/wondow2.JPG' class='weekly' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Car glass is coated with a poly-bunka-junka-chloro-mega-hydro-floxy-stuff, which prevents it from shattering into horrible flying shards of death, like regular glass.

However tempting it might be, please refrain from eating the glass chunks.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew took his car to the police to report the damage, just in case someone was shooting at us.  The police apparently told him the correct response to that question.  I stayed at his apartment, sorting things out with the organ.  Mainly I just turn on the auto rythm, auto bass, and magic chord systems, and hold down the one key that works while I dance around it for hours at a time.  It never gets old.  Someone was saying something about wanting to destroy something.  I don&#039;t know what that was about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew returned with beer.  We had made a non-verbal agreement not to go to the Halloween party, and hide in his Apartment instead.  Madness quickly set in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>CONSEQUENCE NUMBER 3: VARIOUS MADNESSES</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gen had the ocean madness, Pat had the space madness, I had the label madness, and Andrew caught a rare case of the Australian Digeridoo madness.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/curse/madness.gif' class='weekly' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Dear.

I worked there for about a month.  Everything was going perfectly fine.  One day, however, I was unable to log into the database to work on anything.  I inquired about the problem.  We looked into the list of users allowed into the database.  There I was:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-family: &#039;courier new&#039;'>shauvon.g.mc.gill</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extra dot after &#039;mc&#039; makes the G in my last name capitalized.  We didn&#039;t understand why I wasn&#039;t allowed into the database.  Finally, the guy in charge of whatever opened a command prompt program and looked me up.  There I was:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-family: &#039;courier new&#039;'>shauron.g.mcgill</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>'Wait, what?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was absolutely no reason why it would have switched.  I hadn&#039;t sent in any forms or anything recently.  I hadn&#039;t done anything that would have caused them to change my name.  However, there it was:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-family: &#039;courier new&#039;'>shauron.g.mcgill</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>'Hold on.  What?'</b>  It&#039;s not every day that a computer starts mis-pronouncing your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I&#039;ll go ahead and put you in the list, and you&#039;ll have to send an email to the ITAP (information technology at Purdue) helpdesk and request that they fix it,' the guy in charge of whatever said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone, somewhere saw my name written on something and decided that Purdue&#039;s student information, the information that we painstakingly registered two years ago when I signed up to go to Purdue, was wrong.  Someone somewhere saw my name scribbled on a piece of paper and trusted that over Purdue&#039;s officially registered student information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This letter looks a little like an &#039;R.&#039;  I&#039;ll just go ahead and fix it in the computer.'  The person probably thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This student will be so happy that the information in the computer is finally corrected after two years of being wrong.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I sent off an email to ITAP asking them to change it back to shauvon.g.mc.gill.  I like it that way.  It has all the dots in the right places, not an &#039;r&#039; to be found, and it&#039;s actually spelled right.  Those are all good features.  Here&#039;s the email I got back:</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='font-family: courier new; width: 500px; margin-left: 100px'>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nHello Shauron G Mcgill,\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYou contacted the ITaP Customer Service Center 49-44000 itap@purdue.edu Stewart Center G65 about:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIncorrect name change\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYour case is HD0000000108910.

It became:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='font-family: &#039;courier new&#039;'>shauvon.g.mcgill</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever, it&#039;s missing the extra dot that makes my last name correct, but it&#039;s not a big deal.  I was just glad to be Shauvon again.

      "text": "<p>A terrible thing has happened to me recently.  Those of you who know me well will understand what a blow this is.  Kraft foods has repackaged and re-formulated Tang.  Yes, everyone&#039;s favorite astronaut drink has been changed.  It is no longer the tang I used to know and love.  It is different, and it is disgusting.  I am hereby beginning a full boycot on Kraft Foods, to end only when they give me back my Tang.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/oldtang.gif'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>Food companies repackage their products all the time.  Usually this is a harmless attempt to look cooler or better than the competition.  The change in packaging has no effect on the contents.  Usually this is the case.  When such a change occurs, the package will be labeled with phrases such as 'new package, same great product.'  Food companies have very specific recipes for their products, and consumers need to be reassured that those recipes are unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s discuss for a moment why a company would choose to repackage a product.  Perhaps a competitor has repackaged their product, and the company wants to keep up.  Perhaps a new competitor has appeared on the scene, and the company needs to compete.  Neither of these situations apply to tang.  Sure, Koolaide has a very large market, but there is no product that matches the, well, <i>tanginess</i> of Tang.  Let me repeat:  There is no proper substitute for Tang.  With no competition, it should be Kraft&#039;s prerogative to keep Tang the way it is, so as to avoid customer confusion.  As soon as Tang lovers think Tang is no longer the same, they will flee into the waiting arms of the Koolaide man.  This is precisely what is happening with me.  Wait, Kraft also owns Koolaide.  Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/oldtangnutrition.jpg'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>Tang has a very long and illustrious history.  Tang was invented in 1957 by William A. Mitchell.  Mitchell also invented Pop Rocks, Jell-O, and Cool Whip, so Tang comes from a very powerful family.  Tang didn&#039;t find success until 1965, when it was used by NASA in Gemini flights.  Tang caught on, and it has been associated with astronauts since then.  Tang has gone unchanged for fifty years (yes, this year is the fiftieth anniversary of Tang).  Tang has been unchanged, until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November, 1985, General Foods (the company responsible for Tang) was acquired by Philip Morris Companies (the company responsible for tobacco in America).  General Foods had made some acquisitions of their own.  General Foods owned several companies, such as Oscar Mayer, Burger Chef, and Perkins Products Company (the maker of Koolaide).  When Philip Morris bought General Foods, it was the largest non-oil acquisition ever.  Shortly later, Philip bought Kraft Foods, and merged the two companies together.  Little did they know that Kraft would screw it all up in twelve years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Wikipedia, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton all loved Tang when they were in office.  They loved it before Kraft destroyed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a very long time, Tang was served in big plastic containers that held enough Tang for either six quarts or nine quarts.  You did not need to add sugar.  This is what separated it from Koolaide.  Koolaide needs to be mixed with sugar in order for it to work.  Tang was specifically formulated to mix directly with water and drink.  The nutrition facts can be seen to the right.  Those were taken directly from the Kraft website.  Look at that.  Nothing but sugar.  I liked it that way.  I don&#039;t need anything else.  Sugar and flavors.  That&#039;s all I want.  Kraft doesn&#039;t care.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/tang02.jpg'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, I went to Wal-Mart with my friend Andrew Monkey.  I needed to buy some more tang and pizza rolls (I&#039;m almost 21, but I eat like a 10 year old).  Wal-Mart had no tang.  A gaping hole was left in both the powdered drink mix aisle, and also my heart.  A couple weeks later, I returned ot Wal-Mart to try again.  They had Tang, but it was not the same Tang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a very bad feeling about this.  First of all, the new container is a really weird size.  It&#039;s about a third the size of the old six quart container.  The new one makes eight quarts, too.  How can it be smaller, but make more?  It does tell me that it 'makes 33% more than 6 quart Tang.'  It is also pretty open about its low sugar content.  That&#039;s a bad sign.  The worst harbinger of doom is the fact that nowhere on the new package does it say 'new package, same great product.'  Instead, it has some new 'Fruitrition' logo.  I was wary.  'Fruitrition' shares an awful lot of syllables with 'Nutrition,'  and that&#039;s not something I drink Tang for.  I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, and buy the new Tang.  I had no choice, anyway, because as was stated earlier, there is no proper substitute for Tang.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/tang03.jpg'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia acknowledges the new packaging.  The new containers are smaller because they contain a more concentrated formula.  That makes sense, really.  Our technology has advanced quite a bit since 1957.  Why can&#039;t our Tangology have advanced as well?  It must be that Tangologists have merely made a breakthrough in Tanguistics, and now they are able to make the Tang powder more efficiently.  They have also apparently made some breakthroughs in Fruitrition, a complex science reserved for only the top scientific minds.  Technological advancements are good.  However, Tangological advancements are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/tang03B.jpg'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>A look at the back of the package shows that the concentration is not the only thing that has changed.  The new Tang contains only 9 grams of sugar, as opposed to Olde Tang&#039;s 24.  Further examination shows the following ingredients in the Ingredient List:  Maltodextrin; Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, and Neotame (sweeteners).  Why would Tang need sweeteners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly enough, I happened to glance at an empty Splenda packet that my roomate left on the counter.  I immediately recognized the ingredients <b>Sucralose and Maltodextrin.</b>  New Tang is made with Splenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/tang/tang04.jpg'   align='right' hspace='10' />\r\n\r\n<p>It is apparently important to Kraft for Tang to have less sugar than juice.  That is why they have redesigned it.  They haven&#039;t made any breakthroughs in Tanguistics.  They&#039;re just picking a fight.  They&#039;re taking on juice as Tang&#039;s competitor.  That is a strange choice.  Kraft has a hundred other drink products that they could put in this 'better than juice' bracket.  Why do they need to ruin my the drink I have had my entire life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Tang is not the same product as Olde Tang.  <b>I can taste a difference.</b>  You may not notice anything different, but that is just because you do not have the same skills in Tanguistics that I have.  My claims are supported by the fact that the ingredients and Nutrition Facts are different.  New Tang contains Splenda.  It has the distinct artificial sweetener after-taste that Olde Tang did not have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all grew up with Tang.  Tang hasn&#039;t changed significantly in half a century.  If you are like me and you believe that Kraft should not be changing a classic product on its fiftieth aniversary, please voice your opinions directly to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kraft Foods Global, INC. <br />Northfield, IL 60093</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1-800-431-1002</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.kraftfoods.com/main.aspx?m=contact_us/cu_form1'>Click here to send a comment to Kraft</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kraft is a large corporation owned by an even larger corporation.

I wandered into the 'web/info desigs' category to see if there was anything I could do.  I found a few listings for freelance jobs, a few listings for more permanent positions, and a few random other things.  I can&#039;t really do anything permanent, since these are all in the Indy area, and I&#039;m living in West Lafayette (70.6 miles, according to <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/googlemaps.php'>Google Maps</a>).  I sent emails to the few freelance jobs I saw.  Most of those didn&#039;t respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href='../../assets/images/suspicious_listing.JPG' style='width: 550px; display: block; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: auto; float: right; padding: 20px'><img src='../../assets/images/suspicious_listing_small.jpg' alt='Web Designers needed NOW.  Earn dollar signs!!' /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>One entry I found (pictured at right), asks for web designers to work from home creating web graphics.  I&#039;m getting pretty desperate at this point, so I decided to inquire.  I know it looks pretty suspicious, and asking directly for my PHONE NUMBER (clue number one) is a little creepy, but I was curious.  The use of three whole dollar signs was sure enticing (clue number two).  I emailed them my INFORMATION including my PHONE NUMBER, and waited for the same null response that I&#039;ve gotten from pretty much everything else I&#039;ve tried to make money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got the call this morning.  My phone rang out with the CTU ringtone (from the show <i>24</i>) that I think is delightfully ironic and amusing.  The 'restricted number' that was calling immediately made me excited.  I hoped it was the photography store I applied to yesterday, which I would really love to work at.  I was greeted by a sleezy sounding man with a slight accent.  'Show-von McGill?' he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This is he.'  I replied.  Another zany name adventure for '<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=146'>Sho-von</a>' had begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'You responed to an entry on Craig&#039;s List about Web Designer positions?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes.'  The chances of this being about that photography store are getting worse and worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, well how old are you, Show-von?' Clue number three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I&#039;m 21.'  I just turned 21 a few weeks ago.  I still don&#039;t drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, that&#039;s no problem, then.  You&#039;re at Purdue?'  Judging from my email address, I suppose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes, I am.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there was a pause, where I suppose there was some sort of connection problem.  He came back saying 'Are you still there?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Are you still there?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes, I am.'  This whole thing is getting a little too weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Are you at Purdue?'  I guess he didn&#039;t hear me answer the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes, I am.'  I replied again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Were you afraid to answer?'  He asked, apparently he heard nothing after he asked the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'No.'  I answered.  At this point, I wanted the conversation to end and for him not to have my number anymore.  However, I was still curious where this was going.  I would soon find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Well, we work with some adult material, would you be comfortable with adult content?'  He asked.  The cat was out of the bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was not interested in doing porn.  I am not yet that desperate.  Even if I was, I could make quite a bit more dollar signs than that working independently, I feel.  Anyway, my answer was a quick 'No.'  Without even saying anything, the dude hung up.  I guess nobody in the 'adult' industry is known for being polite, but a simple 'that&#039;s not what we&#039;re looking for' would have sufficed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cat was out of the bag.  Curiosity sure killed that cat.

However, we can do a cost-benefit analisys of each type of soda container, and decide which is the most bang for your buck.  All prices I have listed here were taken from the Speedway convenience store just next door to my apartment building.  Can you find better prices?  I would prefer to have average prices on this chart, so if you go somewhere that sells soda, please take note of how much all of these items cost and post the data here (along with where you found them).  As I add more data to the chart, it will approach 'true average.'  When the prices listed here are close to 'true average,' you can see if prices you get are above or below average.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style='margin-left: 10%'>\r\n<tr style='font-weight: bold'>\r\n<td style='width: 280px;'>Container Size</td><td style='width: 200px;'>Number &#039;o&#039; Ounces</td><td style='width: 100px;'>Unit Price</td><td>Price per OZ</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Single Can</td><td>12 OZ</td><td>$.79</td><td>$.065833</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>12 Can box (fridge pack)</td><td>144</td><td>4.29</td><td>.02979167</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Two 12 can boxes (special deal)</td><td>288</td><td>5.98</td><td>.02076389</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>One Liter(re) Bottle</td><td>33.8140226</td><td>1.29</td><td>.03814985</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Two Liter(re) Bottle</td><td>67.6280452</td><td>1.59</td><td>.023511</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Single Serving Bottle (2.5 servings)</td><td>20</td><td>1.39</td><td>.0695</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Two single bottles (5 servings)</td><td>40</td><td>2.00</td><td>.05</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>These results are partially fascinating.  It looks like going with the special 12-pack deal is the cheapest (per ounce) way to go when you buy soda.  The interesting thing is that it is also the most expensive (per unit) way to go.    It is important to note that this chart does not include the loss of value when one of your friends/acquaintances steals some of the cans from your pack.  The Speedway did not have any 24-pack boxes.  Is a 24-pack a better value?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think cans taste better than bottles, and that they hold their temperature better.  Do you think the type of container changes the value of the drink held within?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been buying a lot of 20-ounce bottles lately.  I have been saving up the codes printed on the inside of the bottle caps.  It is disheartening to know that bottles are the worst value when purchasing soda.  I am 38 points, or 10 bottles, away from my goal.  Does getting free crap with the packaging increase the value of the drink held within?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single serving of soda is about 8 ounces (one cup).  None of the containers on this list are separated into 8 ounce servings.  Why do single-use cans contain 1.5 servings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the best deal (not included on this list) is the <b>fountain drink</b>.  Most gas stations and convenience stores sell fountain drinks nowadays.  You can buy 32 ounces of soda (including ice) for as little as $.65.  That is a value of as little as <b>2 cents per ounce</b>.  You can approach the value of two 12-packs with the convenience of not having anyone steal your soda.  If you fill your cup with ice, how much soda are you actually getting?  Do gas stations expect you to fill half your fountain drinks with ice?  This would make an excellent <a href='http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html'>'How much is inside' adventure</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst deal, it would appear, is the 'Single Serving' bottle.  The 20 ounce bottle has been around for a very long time.  Is the added plastic flavor worth the extra 4 cents per ounce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does anyone even buy 1-liter bottles?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>As most of you probably guessed, I&#039;m a pretty big fan of giant battling robots.  When I judge how cool something is, I judge it on a scale of one to ten.  On this scale, one is represented by a bad laser-jet printing of a picture of a skinny man wearing a fanny pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten is giant battling robots, in space, with lasers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should therefore come as little surprise to you that I was somewhat excited about the new Transformers movie.  Transformers are the quintessential fulfillment of the absolute coolest thing, beating out Lego, Star Wars, G.I. Joe, and even Battletech.  Nothing is cooler to a ten-year-old boy, and I am most certainly a ten-year-old boy at heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I certainly lost most of my hard earned respect when I referenced Battletech, so I&#039;ll get to the point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Film critics hate Transformers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hate film critics, and by extension, film reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am therefore not going to write my own review of a movie which I obviously have serious biases for.  I will instead write reviews of the reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Let us begin.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1165257/reviews.php?critic=columns&sortby=default&page=1&rid=1649217'>Transformers review, by Jeffrey Westhoff</a>\r\n<br />Deny Conformity ReviewScore:  <b>1%</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first review I will be critiquing was written by the questionably literate newspaper writer Jeffrey Westhoff.  Westhoff hails from the Northwest Herald, out of Crystal Lake, Illinois.  It would seem that the only thing this newspaper will “herald” is the end of any sense of credibility in printed media as we know it.  That this puerile and almost vulgar insult to writing is actually distributed to a wide audience is sickening.  Westhoff succeeds only at pushing his useless and unintelligent industry further into the deepest, darkest circle of Hell reserved only for him and his kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westhoff begins his asinine rant with the first of many personal attacks on Transformers&#039; director, Michael Bay.  Whatever dark, haunting trauma Westhoff endured in his past to cause him to be so ruthlessly opposed to Bay may never be discovered.  However, hatred this raw and irrational is certainly unhealthy.  Westhoff’s intended punching bag is obvious, with comments like, 'The Transformers, those robots disguised as jets and sports cars, arrive in theaters battling one of the most malevolent forces in the galaxy: Michael Bay. . . &#039;Transformers&#039; fails because it is a Michael Bay film, terrible for the same reasons all this egomaniacal hack’s films are terrible.'  Ouch.  Westhoff then goes on to call Bay a 'Jerry Bruckheimer castoff,' and insults Steven Spielberg merely for associating with Bay.  Like the film he is so respectfully reviewing, the review itself doesn’t actually start until half-way through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the personal attacks off his chest, Westhoff finally gets around to performing the public service he is paid to perform.  I guarantee that whatever salary Jeffrey Westhoff earns, even if he works for free, he is paid far too much for what he does.  Somewhere, buried in his constant references to Michael Bay’s failures, one might be able to scrape together a few sentences that actually pertain to the film he is theoretically reviewing, but they hardly form much in the way of thoughts.  Certainly, the reader instantly gets an understanding of Westhoff’s opinions of the film’s director, but he completely fails to provide many clues to his actual opinion of the film.  Certainly the director is not the only one contributing to the process.  In fact, many of the complaints Westhoff points directly at Bay, for example the inane subplots thrown into the film to waste our time, could not possibly have been Bay’s fault, as he had nothing to do with the screenplay or the story.  Again and again, Westhoff proves that the only thoughts rattling around in that balding empty head of his are about how much he hates Michael Bay.  With a perfectly middle-of-the-road 2 out of 4 that he gave the film, he didn’t really seem to hate it quite as much as it sounds.  Indeed, the review would hardly be different even if he hadn’t seen the movie, which could quite possibly be the reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all of that was not damning enough evidence to prove that Jeffrey Westhoff is a raving lunatic, there is still the most startlingly disgusting aspect of his review left to discuss.  Let us return to the beginning of his review for a moment.  Westhoff bellows, 'Whatever chance that &#039;Transformers,&#039; which is based on the toys that debuted in the 1980s along with a cartoon and a comic book, might have been a decent movie disappeared the moment Bay was hired to direct.'  Certainly, his Bay-bashing intentions are clear, but take a moment to read that sentence again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeffrey Westhoff has been writing published film reviews since 1989, yet he is still incapable of forming a proper sentence?  Was he so intent on his rage for Michael Bay that he couldn’t stop to edit his own writing?  That first, painful sentence stands like the Gates of Hell, warning to 'abandon hope all ye who enter here.'  That first, painful sentence screams at you, pleading with you to just stop reading any further.  Perhaps you think the review could not possibly go anywhere but up after that.  Maybe you continue to read, unable to look away from this horrible car crash you can’t help but watch.  Whatever the case, somehow Westhoff is able to sink further and further, and you realize that those gates standing at the entrance to Hell could not possibly have prepared you for the horrors contained within this putrid review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He ends his review with yet another painful insult.  This one is not directed at Bay, however.  This insult is pointed directly at the Transformers themselves.  Westhoff compares the movie to Go-Bots, the biggest insult to robot-kind that ever was and ever will be.  All this came from the man who called <i>Spiderman 3</i> 'an entertaining, coherent and poignant story.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a field which itself is a pointless failure, Jeffrey Westhoff is a pointless failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned for more reviews of reviews on Denyconformity.com!</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>The time has finally come.  Denyconformity.com has finally been given its first active defense against the spammers.  Now, all comments will be screened by a simple logic question.  Something that computers will hopefully be unable to understand, but which will hopefully be a breeze for any human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term CAPTCHA, or 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart' was first coined by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper (all of Carnegie Mellon University), and John Langford (of IBM).  You can learn more about the CAPTCHA concept on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha'>Wikipedia</a>.  Most CAPTCHAs involve a scrambled image of some type, depicting certain text.  The user has to type that text into a box in order to continue.  The problem I see with such a system is that it is simple enough for a computer to decipher.  Spammers have the technology to get the text out of an image, even if it is rather thoroughly scrambled, and enter it, violating the CAPTCHA.  I am exploring a different approach to the system.  My idea is that while computers can easily decipher scrambled images, they still fail to complete even the simplest logic tests.  Denyconformity.com will use a system based on that theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, when you comment on a post, you will have to answer a simple question in order to continue.  Instead of just copying text from an image, you will actually be required to think.  Hopefully this will screen out anything that I don&#039;t want posting comments on the site, like computers or stupid people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any comments or questions about the system (if, for example, you are unable to answer a CAPTCHA question), feel free to contact me.  Send an email to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>smcgill (put an &#039;at&#039; sign here) denyconformity (put a single period here) com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that computers can also find email addresses on web sites and add them to spam lists.  Spelling out the '@' and the '.' are simple ways to avoid that, apparently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought up many different questions I can ask to prove that you are human.  I decided not to use questions that are too complicated, difficult, or stupid.  Unused CAPTCHA questions include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In C++, how many bytes are allocated for an 'int' variable type?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Plato often spoke of his Theory of Forms.  In two thousand words or less, describe your own thoughts on the theory.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Suppose a standard 8x8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. How can you place 31 dominoes of size 2x1 so as to cover all of these squares?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>While on my way to St. Ives,I met a man with seven wives.Each wife had seven sacks;Each sack had seven cats;Each cat had seven kits. Kits, cats, sacks, wives; How many were going to St. Ives?  (Yes, this is a <i>Die Hard</i> reference)</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Would you like to go on a date with me?  Saying 'no' will verify that you are human.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Which of the following would you most prefer? A: a puppy, B: a pretty flower from your sweety, or C: a large properly formatted data file?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>What year was Khan Noonien Singh born in?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Integrate the following equation: <img src='../assets/images/afx_formula.png' style='vertical-align: middle' alt='Really long, complicated formula.' /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>What questions would be good for CAPTCHAs?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

It claims to be Tang, but it is really?  This isn&#039;t orange, at any rate.  The package is very up-front about its <b>MANGGA FLAVOR INSTANT DRINK MIX</b>.  The title declares the contents to be 'Kraft Hi-Nutrition Tang,' and it bears a logo very similar to the 'frutrition' logo of the blasphemous American New Tang.  However, the ingredients foretell of a glorious non-Splenda future for those who partake in the Hi-nutrition drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/tang/hn_tang4.jpg' height='485' width='500'><p style='width: 300px; padding: 10px; background-color: #ffff00'>Ingredients:  Sugar, Citric Acid, Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose, Calcium Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Vitamins, Permitted Artificial Colors (including Tartrazine), Iron Salt, Flavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, Sugar at the top of the list is a very good sign.  Secondly, 'Sucralose' is nowhere to be found, meaning Splenda is not involved.  <i>What the hell is Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose?</i>, I ask myself.  Wikipedia lists Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose as an emulsifier, basically the agent which causes the powder to mix with water.  New Tang does not list such an agent in its list of ingredients, and I have a theory for this, which I will get to shortly.  Moving down the list, Calcum Phosphate prevents 'caking' because nobody wants Tang cake.  Sodium Chloride is table salt.  Vitamins sounds like when you go to the store and next to the steaks are containers labeled 'meat.'  Tartrazine is a yellow dye, which obviously plays the starring role in this drink mix.  I have no idea what Iron Salt is.  Flavors are apparently the least important ingredient, which I will return to shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/tang/hn_tang3.jpg' height='504' width='500'><p style='width: 300px; padding: 10px; background-color: #ffff00'><b>DIRECTIONS</b><br><br><b>By The Glass:</b><br>Maglagay ng 1 1/2 tablespoons ng Hi-Nutrition <b>TANG</b> sa isang baso.

Directly below that, we see that the package 'PANG 4 LITRO.'  The side asks, 'Ano bang meron ang Tang?  Ang Tang ay siksik sa nutrients na makakatulong sa maraming paraan!'  Then we see a list of vitamins, and what they do for you.  My favorite is next to Vitamin A, 'Nakatulong sa healthy skin and hair.'  Below the vitamin information, is the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 300px; padding: 10px; background-color: #ffff00'>Available din sa CONCENTRATED Litro Pack.

Instantly, my hopes skyrocketed.  It really looked and smelled an awful lot like Olde Tang, or at least what my fading memories remember it to be.  I scooped some into a spoon to take the above picture.  I only spilled a little on the new couch.  The powder is a little more yellow than the legends describe Olde Tang to be.  The whole thing was rather yellow.  It&#039;s hard to see in the pictures, but there is a picture of a mango on the package.  Yellow mangoes in front of a yellow background was not a great choice.  It really smells like Olde Tang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how does it taste?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mixed it together, exactly to the specifications listed in <b>DIRECTIONS</b>.  I Maglagayed exactly 1 1/2 tablespoons ng Hi-Nutrition <b>TANG</b> directly sa isang baso.  The spoonful and a half of powder was enough to makagawa ng 200 mL na drink, so that&#039;s exactly what I, well, makagawad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tentatively stirred, and served.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/tang/hn_tang6.jpg' height='333' width='500'><p>I could immediately tell that this was not Tang.  This was not Orange Tang, by any means, but it wasn&#039;t even Tang at all.  Whatever flavor a drink called Tang might take, it is pretty specific about whether or not the flavor should be tangy.  Without that tang, you&#039;re just drinking orange Koolaide.  Simply put, Hi-Nutrition Tang has no tang.  That being said, it&#039;s not bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated before, Hi-Nutrition Tang includes an emulsifier, to help it dissolve with the water.  Since other drink products don&#039;t contain such emulsifiers, I was curious as to why Hi-Nutrition Tang does.  My theory is that, in order to more acurately represent the 'Mangga Flavor,' the creators added an agent that would give the liquid that tropical feel.  It&#039;s difficult to describe, but there&#039;s a certain <i>thickness</i> to Hi-Nutrition Tang.  The flavor is very subdued (last on the list of ingredients, even), and it almost has more of the texture of real juice to Tang.  Juice texture works out fine for juice, but I just don&#039;t know if it works out for the H-NT.  It really does taste like I figure 'Mangga' tastes like, but the general lack of 'tang' left me unsatisfied.  I feel like every <i>other</i> sip is delicious, which is an odd sensation.  In the end, H-NT is just not delicious enough to make the $2.79 price tag for only Panging 4 Litros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have one last observation to say about the Hi-Nutrition Tang.  The package containing the powder is one of the worst things ever.  There is no way to properly position the package that won&#039;t lead to powder somehow falling out of it all over my desk.  As I type this, I&#039;m trying to think of a way to clean this bit of Tang powder from my desk without getting it inside my keyboard and computer.  The bottom of the package is not made to stand upon, so it&#039;s impossible to just stand the the thing up without it falling and shooting a large cloud of powder all over whatever poor victim happens to be in that direction.  It pangs ng large mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunatly, it would seem that the quest for the True Tang will continue another day.  It was refreshing to have some Tang without Splenda for a change, but Hi-Nutrition Tang was ultimately unsuccessful at filling that void in my soul.  It looks like the Kraft Boycott is still on.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "<p>I had this idea today:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was standing in Discount Den, a local convenience store, waiting in line to pay for the large cup of Dr. Pepper that was about to be my fix for the day.  The infectious, ear-splitting Aphex Twin acid was pumping directly into my brain, loud enough for most of the inhabitants of the store to hear.  I often hope that someone will recognize the endless, insanely complex drum loops AFX does so well, and strike up a conversation.  No dice today, I&#039;m afraid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was hard for me to not notice that the girl standing in front of me in line is one of the most gorgeous women on the face of the planet.  That is an important addition to the story simply because she served as the catalyst for my idea, not necessarily because I think beautiful women should be treated differently.  It is simply a vastly interesting aspect of this universe that extremely gorgeous women happen to catalyze the highest levels of creativity.  Perhaps this reaction in my brain was catalyzed in such a fashion, perhaps not, but nevertheless, as a matter of literary description, the person standing in front of me was breathtaking.  I don&#039;t even remember anything specific about her.  She just had the general air of someone who is interesting and truly beautiful in every way that counts.   She was getting a tube of chap-stick when I entered the line behind her.  The pure efficiency of her 'enter the line, then get the things you need' game plan was what probably attracted me to her in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had one earbud in her left ear.  Her head was turned toward the chap-stick, minor pain killer, and contraceptive section, which placed her right ear - the one without a headphone - toward me.  I was praying to every possible god that she would recognize the Aphex Twin I was listening to and further prove herself to be the most attractive woman alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She didn&#039;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I was anybody else on the planet I would have been able to talk to her.  I would have said 'nice day for chapstick,' or 'nice weather we&#039;re having,' or even 'you&#039;re the most beautiful woman I&#039;ve ever seen.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#039;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, we both did what everyone else in the store was doing.  We filed on, quietly and patiently awaiting our turn at the registers, trying to ignore the guy standing behind me talking on his cellular phone at an obnoxious volume.  'Oh, they&#039;re having sex tonight?' he cooed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I was anybody else on the planet I would have told the guy off, thereby impressing the gorgeous girl in front of me, and saving the world once again from the perils of people who don&#039;t know how to behave in public situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#039;t do that, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, I waited patiently for my turn.  Finally the girl in front of me and I both made it to the registers.  This particular establishment has two such systems, allowing twice the flow of a similar, but less equipped store.  It just happened that the two registers, and the two partially-punk clerks standing behind them became available at the same time.  The gorgeous girl and I quietly (except for the AFX) went up to the plate.  I had my giant cup of Dr. Pepper, and she had her extremely efficient chapstick.  She quickly asked her clerk to give her a particular pack of clove-cigarettes, another trait that did nothing but add allure to her already divine appearance.  It was around this point that I came up with my idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I thought was nothing new, but as a foolish young man with an impossible insta-crush on a gorgeous girl I&#039;d never met, I thought I was a genius.  The partially-punk clerk standing at register number one asked me if the drink I was carrying was all I had.  I paused for a few insanely complex drum loops, and responded with the affirmative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I only had a few more moments, a few more insanely complex drum loops to compose myself, I would not have nodded at my partially-punk clerk.  'Why, no it isn&#039;t,' I would have said, 'I&#039;m also paying for her.'  I would have made a quick nod to the gorgeous girl, who was waiting for her partially-punk clerk to get her the particular brand of clove-cigarettes she asked for.  I would have added the gorgeous girl&#039;s items to my charge, and I would have paid for them with a smile.  'Don&#039;t even worry about it,' I would have told her, 'I just want to do a nice thing for a pretty girl.'  I would have been on my way, feeling like the nice kind of guy, the self-less kind of guy, and also the outrageously nervous, heart&#039;s-about-to-explode kind of guy.  I would have maybe introduced myself, and then I might have had a name to put with the gorgeous girl, instead of just 'gorgeous girl.'  I might have done all of those things.  I wouldn&#039;t even have needed to be anybody else on the planet to do all of those things.  I had all that inside me, and I was completely determined and ready to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I didn&#039;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I panicked, gave the nod to my clerk, paid extremely fast, and got out of the place as fast as I could.  I almost turned around and went right back in, ready to say 'actually, I&#039;m going to pay for hers, too.'  But I still didn&#039;t.  You could, quite accurately, say that I unarguably and unequivocally manned down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the experience was not a total loss.  I thought about the idea as I was hiding somewhere afterwards, and I definitely think it could be a very good one.  Not to pick up women, although that would certainly be a nice bonus, but just to add a bit of kindness to an otherwise cruel and 'boner-killing' world.  Imagine a world where people do that sort of thing all the time.  Wouldn&#039;t you be more excited about going out and socializing if things like that happened all the time?  Why would we hide behind our earbuds and our Aphex Twin if we knew the world wasn&#039;t so cruel after all?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friends, I invite you to get out there and do something nice for someone.  It could be the gorgeous girl you see at Discount Den, or it could be an elderly woman who is having trouble carrying her groceries.  Open a door for someone who has their hands full.  Tell someone they look nice today.  Bring the person who has been outside handing out fliers all day a bottle of water.  Talk on your cellphone more quietly, or even consider turning it off sometimes.  Humor someone, tell a stranger a joke, or just smile every once in a while.  Do it enough, get other people doing it, and eventually it won&#039;t be a task anymore.  Eventually, it will just be one huge friendly society.  It may be a stupid idea, and I&#039;ll probably just get my boner killed in a very short amount of time, but it could also work.  It won&#039;t kill us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could, dare I say it, <i>change the world!</i>  Haven&#039;t you wanted to change the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anybody has any thoughts, comments, or experiences with this idea, that&#039;s what the comments box down below is for.  Just please try not to kill my boner too hard.  Also, I&#039;m sorry for using such a vulgar term like 'boner-killer.'  It&#039;s just a term I use to describe something that is an extreme emotional let-down, except that it flows off the tongue easier than 'extreme emotional let-down.'</p>",

See 'Favorite Links' there?  Have you ever wanted to change those links?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can.  It&#039;s really simple.  Windows XP users might not even attept to change them, because XP forced users to stick with whatever folders were there by default.  Sure you could change them, but it involved complicated forays into the registry, which is something most people are not comfortable with.  However, Windows Vista allows you to put whatever you want into your Favorite Links.  Here&#039;s how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s two ways to do it.  One is easy, and the other is really easy.  First, navigate to your User Folder.  That should be right under 'Desktop' under 'Folders' on the left side of Windows Explorer.  Next, go into your Links folder.  There they are, the shortcuts that appear in the Favorite Links panel.  Open a second Explorer window, and navigate to whatever location you want.  Click the right mouse button on whatever folder you want to send to the Links, and while holding the right mouse button down, drag it to the Links folder.  Release the right mouse button and click 'Place Shortcut Here.'  You&#039;ve done it.  The easier way is to just drag folders or other shortcuts directly to the Favorite Links panel in Windows Explorer.  Give it a try, it&#039;s fun and it increases productivity surprisingly well.  I have a link to Downloads, Videos, Documents, and Program Files (x86) in mine.  Unfortunately, you can only put shortcuts to folders there, so you can&#039;t add your most common programs to the list.  You can resize the Favorite Links panel, though, to accommodate additional shortcuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That does it for today.  Keep using that Vista, and you&#039;ll be doing things you never even dreamed of in no time, such as actually liking Windows Vista.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "<p>Valve software (the creators of the <i>Half Life</i> computer games) is going to release a new collection of games on October 9th.  They have these three games, each extremely interesting, and they decided (brilliantly) to release them all at once, in the same package.  It&#039;s called <i>The Orange Box</i>, and it&#039;s one of the most highly anticipated games of the year (move over, <i>Halo 3</i>).  The three games are <i>Half Life 2: Episode 2</i>, <i>Portal</i>, and <i>Team Fortress 2</i>.  The new chapter of Half Life is a really big deal, because it has all the excitement and emotional attachment of <i>Lost</i>, <i>Heroes</i>, and <i>Grey&#039;s Anatomy</i>.  Seriously, this one is a big deal.  <i>Portal</i> is a very intriguing pseudo-puzzle game, which you really have to see to properly understand.  You can Google it if you wish.  Finally, <i>Team Fortress 2</i> is a multiplayer game with such unique art design and production qualities that it really stands above all other multiplayer games.  I&#039;m not a huge fan of the online experience, but I&#039;ve been playing <i>Team Fortress 2</i> more in the last week or so than any other game I&#039;ve had in quite a while.  Valve decided to release a 'beta' version of <i>Team Fortress 2</i> ahead of the other two games in the package, just to give the thousands of people who bought the game already something to do.  I am one of those people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here is my list of ten things I like about <i>Team Fortress 2</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The game is extremely easy for beginners to pick up.  The game has nine different classes (which changes your appearance, skills, and weapons), and they each have their own pros and cons.  Each class supports a different play style, so if you aren&#039;t comfortable with running around and shooting people, you don&#039;t necessarily have to.  This allows new players to warm up to the more complex game mechanics by starting off with some of the easier classes.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game is instantly recognizable.  Nobody can look at a screenshot of <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, and confuse it with a different game.  Just look at some pictures of it on Google, and you&#039;ll see what I mean.  It&#039;s gorgeous.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game is simple, but not too simple.  It is very easy to know exactly what you need to do and what the general situation is, but it&#039;s not boring.  There&#039;s plenty to think about without being overwhelmed.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game is meticulously designed.  Absolutely every aspect of the design is painstakingly thought out, to ensure that nothing detracts from the experience.  Valve playtests all of their games thoroughly, so that they see exactly how players react to specific aspects.  This means that every single rock, piece of wood, building, and map is in the most perfect location to ensure balanced and fair play.  The game only has a handful of maps, because they are so meticulously poured over.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game hardly gets old.  Sure, the novelty of the amazing graphics wears off a little bit, but the game itself does not get boring as you get used to it.  If you&#039;re sick of a certain class, or you just can&#039;t seem to get anything done, you have eight other classes to choose from.  Simply switch classes, and it&#039;s like you&#039;re playing an entirely different game.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game has commentary.  Just like a DVD, you can load up a special version of a few levels and listen to the developers talk about the game and the processes involved with designing it.  This is an extraordinary addition, which allows you to see just how much thought went into it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game is on Steam.  There has been much argument over whether Steam is good or bad.  However, having the ability to instantly join your friends in a game (even when you&#039;re not in the game at all), and the automatic updating system is a very good thing.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game is fun.  Even when everything is working, and 24 players are all shooting rockets at each other, and you&#039;re losing, and you can&#039;t seem to get anything accomplished, the game is still pretty fun.  Sure it&#039;s challenging, and it makes you think, but it is also fun, which is important.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game promotes camaraderie.  I can easily recognize other guys on my team, and after a while I can really develop a bond with them.  I really enjoy helping guys who have helped me out, and it is very motivating to know exactly who keeps scoring kills against me.  This is the strength of an online game, because all of the other players are human.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The game has incredible detail.  I&#039;ve played it for 20+ hours over the last week and a half, and I&#039;m still finding new things in the levels and characters.  All of the different classes yell out taunts and other phrases, and it&#039;s a really great feeling to do something really awesome and hear your character yelling out his approval.  Each level has hundreds of little secret nooks and crannies, which will take years to fully explore (especially while people are shooting at you).</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

Premiere should be just starting up now.</li>\r\n<li>Turn on the camera, activate the capture system by hitting F5.</li>\r\n<li>Name the tape and the clip something just as hilarious as before.</li>\r\n<li>Capture the tape.</li>\r\n<li>Do various things to amuse yourself, including browsing the internet, looking around at other people in the lab, and . . . well, that&#039;s about all there is to do.</li>\r\n<li>Finally, after an excruciating 45 minutes, stop the capture and save the file.  Check it to make sure it works.</li>\r\n<li>Repeat the last five steps for the other three tapes you have that you need to capture.</li>\r\n<li>Once you&#039;re all done capturing the video, and you have 30 gigabytes of video, you have to copy it to your external hard drive.</li>\r\n<li>Plug in the external hard drive.</li>\r\n<li>For some reason, the computer can&#039;t copy anything to your external hard drive.  Discover a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomache.</li>\r\n<li>Go to the front desk and ask to rent an external hard drive, hoping they aren&#039;t out yet.</li>\r\n<li>Get the last drive, and bring it back to the computer.</li>\r\n<li>The files won&#039;t copy to it, either.  Rediscover that sinking feeling.</li>\r\n<li>Ask the lab monitors what the flarp.  They tell you that you can&#039;t just copy files to the drive, you have to create folders first.</li>\r\n<li>Return to you desk, particularly flummoxed by this curious restriction.  Create a folder named 'giant sloth' and copy the videos to it.</li>\r\n<li>Wait another thirty minutes for the files to copy.</li>\r\n<li>Once they&#039;re done, turn in the camera and the tripod, and take the external hard drive home.</li>\r\n<li>Copy the files to your hard drive, where they should have been hours ago if only the stupid thing worked right.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Where there you go.

One of the power surges killed his computer.  The surge killed it so hard, it damaged his registry somehow, so Windows Vista wouldn&#039;t boot anymore.  It just asked for the Vista installation disk, so that it could repair itself.  The problem was that I left the disk at school, so it was about two hours away.  What to do?

      "text": "<p>I currently work as a computer technician in the Agricultural Economics department at Purdue university.  It&#039;s not the most glamorous job in the world, or the most interesting, but it beats working all night at a coffee shop.  I have to work early in the morning, but that means my evenings and weekends are free.  There are certain times, however, when it is totally awesome to have my job.  One of those times happened today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I arrived this afternoon, and sat down waiting for something to break so I could fix it.  That&#039;s the majority of my job.  One of my bosses came into the tech shop, and asked me if I knew anything about spyware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I know a little about it, yes.' I responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Well, one of our faculty is getting a strange error message.  When you have time, could you go up to her office and take a look at it?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Sure.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No problem, I thought.  I&#039;ll just get a copy of AdAware and HijackThis on my Mr. Blasty, and do a thorough scan and clean of the computer in question.  I went on up to the office, and took at look.  Sure enough, there was the strange error message.  'Warning, your computer is infected by spyware.  Download anti-spiware tools now.' It said.  It definitely looked bogus.  Initially I thought that it was just a pop up, which can happen when you get spyware.  On closer inspection, however, I saw that it wasn&#039;t in a window, and as a result it had no close button.  I logged out of the user&#039;s account, so that I could work in the administrator account.  That&#039;s when I saw what the 'warning message' really was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Windows logged out, the warning stayed, centered in the middle of the desktop, even after everything else had closed.  It was a wallpaper.  It was nothing more than a simple desktop background.  AdAware and HijackThis confirmed that there were no questionable files anywhere on the computer.  All I did was search the local disk for '*.jpg' and '*.bmp'.  There it was, 'dfdfdhejahdjhiv.bmp' right in the System folder.  I deleted the file, restarted the computer, and it was all back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, I made up a very technical story about how I had to use a few special pieces of software to find the corrupted programs and remove them safely.  'It was tough, but I was able to get it all fixed up.  These bugs just find their way onto your computer, and there isn&#039;t much you can do to stop them.  Luckily, though, I&#039;m around, and I got it fixed up.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was a hero.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

I&#039;m only saying, because it&#039;s interesting to me to actually quantify what I do all day.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>7:00 AM - I woke up extremely started by my alarm clock.</li>\r\n<li>7:30 AM - I arrived at work, ready to be a hero again.</li>\r\n<li>10:30 AM - I had some downtime while a computer slowly updated itsself, so I did some research for my other job (designing a flash game for a CGT professor).  This was an extremely efficient hour, working two jobs at once.</li>\r\n<li>11:30 AM - I left work and decided to go to the convenience shop to get some lunch.  I got some trail mix and Dr. Pepper.</li>\r\n<li>12:00 PM - Class, business law.  It&#039;s more interesting than it sounds, really.</li>\r\n<li>1:15 PM - Then I went to the underground library, to meet with the other members of <a href='http://www.ara2008.com'>Ara, LLC</a>.</li>\r\n<li>1:30 PM - The other members arrived, and we found a meeting room to discuss our project.</li>\r\n<li>2:45 PM - Wrapped up meeting, with some great ideas in mind.</li>\r\n<li>3:00 PM - Stopped by PAO hall on my way home to try to find Rich Rand.  I hoped not to run into anybody, because I just wanted to get home and get to work on Job #2.</li>\r\n<li>3:30 PM - Finally arrived home, after 8 hours wondering around taking care of business.  I still had laundry to do, though.</li>\r\n<li>3:45 PM - Dropped off my stuff, found that Andrew had done the dishes (awesome) and went to the bank to get quarters for laundry.</li>\r\n<li>4:00 PM - Got $10 in quarters, got back to the apartment.  I grabbed my laundry (about 4 weeks of clothes) and set off for the laundry room.</li>\r\n<li>4:15 PM - Laundry working, I finally had a moment to sit down, watch an episode of <i>Boston Legal</i> and have a bowl of soup (my first actual meal of the day).</li>\r\n<li>5:00 PM - Switched laundry into dryer.</li>\r\n<li>5:10 PM - Got to work on Job #2, working up some designs for this flash game intended to keep kids in school.</li>\r\n<li>6:10 PM - Andrew went to put his laundry into dryers, and I chased after him, in a comical fashion.  I really hope the group of people we passed wondered what the Hell was going on.</li>\r\n<li>6:15 PM - Gathered up dry clothes.  I commented that this was the first time I&#039;ve ever not had to dry my clothes a second time.  They were nice and dry after round one.  Cue torrential downpour.</li>\r\n<li>6:20 PM - Andrew ran and got an umbrella for me, and we ran through the unbelievably wet world back to the apartment.  So much for my perfectly dry clothes.</li>\r\n<li>6:30 PM - Back to work on the designs.  I came up with two pretty good looking ones.</li>\r\n<li>8:30 PM - I took a break to watch another episode of <i>Boston Legal</i>.</li>\r\n<li>9:15 PM - Back to work.</li>\r\n<li>10:30 PM - Andrew was playing Team Fortress 2, and I couldn&#039;t resist.  I fired it up, but our terrible internet dashed my hopes.  The speed here is horrible after about 8.  I wrote yet another furious email to the cable company, asking them to do something about it.  Instead of playing, I ended up just sending a few important emails scheduling a myriad of meetings tomorrow.</li>\r\n<li>11:15 PM - I decided to write a post about what I did today.  You&#039;re reading that right now.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheesh, what a day.  If anybody&#039;s counting, today I worked for nine hours (plus I&#039;m going to try to get another hour or two in before bed), was in class for two, and had meetings and other business for about four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a start to the rest of my life . . .</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

You&#039;re not nearly as good as Justice, mind you, but you&#039;re not bad.  I&#039;d call you this generation&#039;s Darude, if Darude wasn&#039;t already this generation&#039;s Darude.  I have one pretty major gripe, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I listen to Electronic so that I don&#039;t have to wade through a bunch of crappy lyrics to get good music.  Lyrics are retarded in 90% of music.  What&#039;s the deal with you and a bunch of other electronic artists thinking you need to throw in some rich-sounding female voice talking about feelings and desires?  Do you know why <a href='http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/robotrock.html'>'Robot Rock'</a> or <a href='http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/aroundtheworld.html'>'Around the World'</a> are better Daft Punk tracks than <a href='http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/facetoface.html'>'Face to Face'</a> (click the links, look at the lyrics, and you&#039;ll get your answer).  Justice rocks hard, but do you know which tracks rock the least?  That&#039;s right, it&#039;s D.A.N.C.E. and Tthhee Ppaarrttyy, because they&#039;re the ones with the stupid female voices talking about feelings and desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s one exception, of course, but we don&#039;t need to count him.  Benny Bennassi gets away with it because he&#039;s insane.  He&#039;s coming out with his <i>fourth</i> album this summer, and guess what, it&#039;s going to sound exactly the same as every other track he has ever made.  I can stand stupidly written female vocals when they&#039;re backed by awesome-sounding buzzing synth loops.  Once you get some awesome-sounding buzzing synth loops, Tiesto, I&#039;ll put up with your stupid female vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And since I&#039;ve got you here, <i>DJ Tiesto</i>, I should tell you what the fans of electronic music have secretly been wanting to tell you for eight years.  MAN UP.  I&#039;m sick of sitting around for two to five minutes waiting for you to get around to actually starting a track.  You build and build and build and build, and we wait and wait and wait, and then you finally get to the good part, and then you almost immediately end the track.  Does Justice make us wait for heart-destroying rage-house?  Does Benny Bennassi make us wait for that insidious buzz-synth?  No, they don&#039;t.  Daft Punk sits around all day just looping the same intro to a song that doesn&#039;t even exist, and you think you&#039;re doing something groundbreaking when you do the exact same thing, Tiesto?  I want to hear your tracks, not the endless intros to your tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 6/8/08</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, I got Benassi&#039;s new album.  What happened, Benny?  Did your compressor break?  You know, you can get another one.  In fact, <i>I&#039;ll</i> buy you another one, because this stuff just doesn&#039;t sound right.  And what&#039;s with those male vocals?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

It&#039;s called La Village, which is French for The Village (the part of West Lafayette where it is located).  They have all sorts of crazy foreign food items, like Paratha, a delicious fried bread thing that we&#039;ve enjoyed with some curried rice and whatnot.  We&#039;ve also discovered a thing called Gulab Jamoon, which is a lot more fun to say that it is to eat, but it&#039;s still an interesting treat.  Another 'treat' offered at La Village is the Mixed Mithai, an assortment of weird . . . things . . . in a little plastic container.  We&#039;ve wondered what the hell Mixed Mithai really entailed, so on Friday night, John and I decided to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_01.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>Only $5.79&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_02.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>for . . . whatever this is</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me clear the air.  I&#039;m not going to build suspense for this review, and make you wonder whether or not Mixed Mithai is any good or not.  It&#039;s not good.  In fact, it could be called horrid.  I want it to be absolutely clear that under no circumstances should you ever try to eat Mixed Mithai.  Especially not for the '$5.79&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;' that I paid for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we tried the first 'mixed mithai.'  I decided that this should be recorded for posterity&#039;s sake, since we certainly weren&#039;t getting our money&#039;s worth out of the product itsself.  I remembered I had this website thing that I&#039;ve forgotten about for like 6 months, and I decided to come up with a review, to ward others away from thinking it would be 'worth a shot' as we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, let&#039;s get on with the various 'mithai' in all their 'mixed' glory.  I&#039;m not sure what Mithai means in whatever language it&#039;s supposed to be.  It&#039;s probably some sort of joke at Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><strong>White + Green Roll Thing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first item was a sort of tube like structure, with white stuff on the outside and a green paste on the inside.  I didn&#039;t get a picture, because it was only after choking it down that we decided to document the rest of the adventure.  Upon first biting into it, I figured that it probably wasn&#039;t fully cooked, because that was the only reason I could think of to explain why it was so unpleasant.  It wasn&#039;t terrible, mind you.  I could have eaten a little more of it (which is good, as you&#039;ll soon see), but it wasn&#039;t very fun.  John described it as 'Minty but not mint.'  He called it weird.  Weird is pretty much the defiinition of 'Mixed Mithai.'  We both felt it was probably the odd Mithai out, and moved on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&#039;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><strong>White Square Thing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_23.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>The White Square Thing</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up was the cube-shaped white square thing.  I didn&#039;t try it, because I was getting my camera out, but John ate an entire cube of it.  The package generously offered two whole cubes of the white paste-like stuff.  Here is the rundown of John&#039;s observations, as he examined and ate it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'It looks very non-descript.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'It tastes very non-descript.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'But it&#039;s got texture. . . It&#039;s got a whole lot of texture.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This tastes a lot like that roll.  Oh wait!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The white stuff on the outside of the roll must have been the same white stuff that composed the white square thing.  That was a pretty obvious conclusion.  The white Mithai was also conveniently supplied in a much flatter Trapezoid configuration, to serve your particular mithai needs.  I had a piece of the trapezoid.  It was pretty non-descript.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><strong>Green Block</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_22.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>The Green Block</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was pretty obvious that if the white block was the white part from the white + green roll thing, then the green block was probably equally represented there.  'Is this the green bit from inside the roll?' John asked.  'If so, can I make it through an entire block of the stuff?'</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_04.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>The Green Block</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, he did, with a sort of determination I haven&#039;t seen in someone before.  He quickly went for a bottle of Tonic Water to wash it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'It is the stuff.' He said, remembering it&#039;s mint-less minty flavor.  I asked him if it was growing on him.  'I&#039;ve acquired a bit,' he said, right before gulping down some more tonic water.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><strong>Orange Blob</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_24.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>There are two of them.  How lucky . . .</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a very unique member of the mixed mithai assortment.  It&#039;s hard to really describe it.  In fact, it was very hard, surprisingly so.  It looks slimy and soft almost like orange cottage cheese (. . . yum), but it was actually hard and dry, like a golf ball (not quite as hard).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_05.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>As big as a golf ball, too.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>'It definitely tasted fried,' John said, as he took a bite, 'it tastes like vegitable oil.'</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_06.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>A tentative bite.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It did taste like vegitable oil.  This one wasn&#039;t bad.  It had a slightly more gritty and slightly less pasty texture than the white or green stuff, and it was kind of sweet, once you got past the vegitable oil.  I quickly realized that my tiny, tentative bites were not getting me very close to finishing the entire blob.  Those little things just keep going and going.  I wasn&#039;t very interested in keeping that up, so I set it down and we moved on.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><strong>Orange Cube</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_25.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>The Orange Cubes</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two kinds of orange cubes in the package.  One had much more stuff on top of it.  We went for the cleaner one first.  John took his bite, and immediately said 'This one tastes weird.'</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_08.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>'This one tastes weird.'</div>\r\n\r\n<p>John said it tasted like the white <em>and</em> the green, which at that point was a pretty big departure for the Mithai.  It had all been pretty much identical, except for the Vegitable Oil-laced blobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then John said it tasted like wood.  The flavors just kept on coming.  Listen, folks, <em>this one was the real deal</em>.  It smelled somehow reminiscent of raw bread dough.  It <em>did</em>.  I was <em>not</em> looking forward to tasting it.  I bit off a tiny chunk and lied to my mouth, claiming it was actually food.  My mouth had a hard time believing me, and my stomach almost sent it back for re-analysis.  <em>I wasn&#039;t a big fan.</em>\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>'So that&#039;s where all the flavor went.' I said.  Definitely not as non-descript as the white cubes.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p>That&#039;s all I can bear to remember right now.  I&#039;ll continue this saga soon, with both the best and the worst of the Mithai left to explore (yes, it gets worse).  See you then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00189'>Continue to Part 2</a></p>\n\n",

They weren&#039;t bad to eat, either.  I still wouldn&#039;t eat them given the choice, but they were the definite standout of everything in the package.  They tasted somewhat like stale caramel, as John described them.  They were very doughy, though.  Their texture was very weird, like that weird stuff you get from mixing corn starch and water.  Sort of like an eraser, but not at all chewy.  It&#039;s very hard to describe this stuff.  I hope I&#039;m not making it alluring, because I don&#039;t want to make anybody want to try it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The white cookie thing was definitely the most palatable of the entire mixed mithai.  What an achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rainbow Thing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_11.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>Ugh, the Rainbow Thing</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh man, the rainbow thing.  We were <em>not</em> excited about diving in to that one.  John looked at it and said, 'Now . . . the rainbow thing . . . oh guugh.'  To say he was tentative would have been an understatement.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_13.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>John is quite sarcastic.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It looked like the indian flag, as John pointed out, sans emblem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_11.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>All hail king of the Mithai</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried mithai with one color, we tried it with two colors, but this was three colors.  As John described, 'I can guess what the white and the green layers taste like, but the wild card is that red one.  The question is what chord will it ring with the other two?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He found out.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_12.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>Oh God.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>He bit it, set it down, and took a step back.  It was not a good chord.  I tried it next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My taste buds are pretty subdued as it is, and I&#039;m kind of nursing a cold right now, which dulls them further.  Food has never been a big deal for me.  Even still, nothing could have prepared me for the punch in the face that was the rainbow thing.  It had the same odd, gritty texture as the white or green stuff, and the flavor of those were very well represented.  The red . . . well, take it this way:  the taste of mithai seems to go on a scale.  It goes from barely palatable to absolutely horrible as it goes from white, to green, to red.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_11.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>Threat level red.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rainbow Thing is the pinnacle of Mixed Mithai.  It was the end of the road for us.  John decided to explore the red further, for science.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_15.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>What does the red taste like, alone?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_17.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>It doesn&#039;t look that bad.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_18.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>Oh God.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_14.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, it was still bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a few things left in the package, but we both decided that their flavors could be extrapolated from what we had already tried.  We cut our losses and called it a Mixed Mithai night.  Back in the fridge they went, and John and I both sat down.  It seemed the mithai sat in our stomaches about as well as it sat in our mouths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\r\n\r\nOf all the mixed mithai, the cookie thing was the definite winner.  That needs perspective, though.  The cookie thing was like the first American Pie movie.  It was ok compared to the other ones, but wouldn&#039;t you rather just watch a couple episodes of the Office again?  If taken alone, the cookie thing would probably be one of the worst things I&#039;ve ever eaten.\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_20.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The rainbow thing, on the other hand, will haunt my dreams and be the basis of comparison for every horrible thing I eat for the rest of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/mithai/mithai_21.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto'><div class='caption'>The Horation Sanz of the SNL that is Mixed Mithai.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, Andrew came over and found the remaining mithai in the fridge.  I tried to stop him, but he dove right in. A few minutes later he had finished the entire container.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Those are pretty good.' He said.</p>\n\n",

I checked the code that showed up on the browser (the page you&#039;re looking at right now) and nothing was out of the ordinary.

That index.php file just has one little string of text and one javascript command.  It immediately redirects the browser to http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php.  I did it this way because I use Javascript on my site, and I wanted to let people know that if they don&#039;t have Javascript enabled they won&#039;t be able to view the site.  Also, I wanted to have a particular directory structure, so I wanted to have the actual main page within a sub directory.  Anyway, I disabled javascript and checked the code my browser was getting on that index.php page.

I&#039;ll have my room mate John look it up in Linux to see what it is (the virus will probably not affect Linux at all).  When the browser loads my page, it loads that iframe, and then it downloads the virus.  It&#039;s a very common hack on websites (Avast! calls it JS:Agent-AV [Trj]).  Don&#039;t worry, if you&#039;ve gone to Denyconformity.com in the last however long, you haven&#039;t gotten any viruses.  This code could not, and will not, ever work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That snippet of code only showed up on the http://www.denyconformity.com/index.php page.  It was thrown in at the end of the page, as you can see, after my own javascript that redirects the browser somewhere else (as long as you have javascript on).  So if you have javascript enabled, the browser will never execute that code, because it will be redirected before it gets there.  If you have javascript disabled, the browser will never execute that code because it is a javascript command.  The iframe, and the virus, will never be executed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This code snippet was probably added by some sort of robot, just throwing this code up on the index page of whatever website it could find.  Thankfully, because of the way I put my site together, the robot just put the harmful code in a spot where it would do no harm (except freak AVG and Avast! out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in conclusion, a simple little page that I created a long time ago to simplify my file structure ended up protecting my site, and your computer, from some harmful doodads. Bullet dodged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I need to talk to my webhost to find out why someone was able to hack my site . . .</p>",

First, before you continue, make sure you&#039;ve read the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00164'>The first article, which started this whole fiasco.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00173'>The first update, with a not-so successful replacement.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00174'>Another update.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Monkey. He&#039;s almost on his way to Spain, and could be there when you read this. He loves him some <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00188'>mixed mithai</a>. He&#039;s also my hero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because he brought this into my life:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_01.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The lid labels never survive on these things, but you get the idea.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I continue, I&#039;ll just quiet your suspicions right now. I&#039;m sure, if you read the previous articles about Tang, that you&#039;re wondering, 'could it be?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Yes, it could.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m getting ahead of myself, as I am want to do. Let me explain where this came from. Andrew was in his hometown of New Albany, Indiana, and he went to an Hispanic Grocery Store. That store was selling a brand of Tang, presumably sold in Hispanic countries, which looked awfully familiar and 'fruitrition-less.' It has the classic shape and size, before they made the formula more 'concentrated.' Let&#039;s take a look at the ingredients, just to see what it&#039;s got under the hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_03.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Kraft Foods Puerto Rico knows how to do their job.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugar. Check. Citric Acid for tartness. Check. Less than 2% of flavor. Check. No sign of sucralose. Double Check. This definitely looks like it could be good. Let&#039;s have a look at the product itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_05.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Oh boy.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_04.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Orange gold.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It looks like Olde Tang. It smells like - well, it smells like Real Sugar Orange Fanta, which isn&#039;t far off from Olde Tang.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_02.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Made with real sugar, not corn syrup.

It tasted really good. But did it really taste like Olde Tang? We couldn&#039;t be sure.  Not without a taste test, that is!

First off, there were differences between the two drinks. That could certainly have been attributed to the archive Olde Tang losing a bit with age, for sure. They were both good, but one was pretty clearly better. One of them was a little grittier, which I figured was the Olde Tang not mixing particularly well, but after thoroughly re-mixing it, it tasted better than the other one. It would seem that the newcomer was not quite as good as Olde Tang, but it was definitely good <em>enough</em>. Andrew wanted to verify which was which, but I couldn&#039;t. I had to make it completely untraceable, or my overly-critical mind would be immediately tainted by knowing which was which. He was frustrated that we wouldn&#039;t be able to know for sure which was better (although I was pretty sure that the difficulty of mixing the one proved which it was).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered that knife he was sharpening earlier, and decided to make an effort to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I remembered that we had been taking pictures the whole time. Duh. I looked at the two cups, and sure enough, one of them - the one which tasted better, in fact - had considerably more worn flamingos than the other one. I checked the footage and compared the flamingo wear patterns to the cups.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_15.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Olde Tang. Intact Flamingos.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_12.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Newcomer. Faded Flamingos.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>'Andrew . . .' I said. 'The faded flamingos were on the New Tang . . .'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Jump Ten was all that could express our excitement. Nobody was around to take a picture of it, unfortunately, but rest assured it was <em>awesome</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New New Tang was the one we liked better. My life is finally complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as a guiding light for the rest of the world, more than a year after this whole fiasco started, I give you the solution (for now, until Puerto Rico gets wise). A couple weeks later, a giant box arrived in the mail. Andrew had ordered an entire case of the New New Tang from the same store he bought the first one from. Opening that box of twelve wonderful canisters was one of the highlights of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/tang_23.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Tang is back.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As a side note, with this boon of Tang, we&#039;ve explored new possible applications for the delicious no-longer-just-breakfast drink. John, whom you might remember from our Mixed Mithai adventure, is a fan of high-class, expensive alcohol, particularly Gin. Late one night, while I was getting a midnight snack of a glass of Tang, and John was getting a midnight snack of a glass of Boodles British Gin, we accidentally ran into each other, mixing the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Hey, you got Boodles in my Tang!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Hey, you got Tang in my Boodles!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Heyyyy!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Crazy Monkey was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/newTang/mcgill_photo.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Boodles and Tang: The Crazy Monkey</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I&#039;ve tried it, and yes it&#039;s pretty delicious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more side-note: someone who happened upon my Tang article emailed me a few days ago. He was a big fan of the Tang-ish drink Sunny Delight, and he said that it has recently gone the 'fruitrition' route, following Tang where consumers are unable to follow. What are drink-makers thinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And people wonder why the economy is a complete mess.</p>",

      "text": "<p>Dear Andrew,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How are you? I am fine. You&#039;ve been in Europe for about a month now. I know you know that, I&#039;m just recapping what the situation is so you know I have reserved brain space for remembering what happens to you. Anyway, you&#039;ve been in Europe for like a month or whatever. Or maybe you were in England for some of that, I don&#039;t know. I hope you&#039;re having fun. I hope you&#039;re having tons of stupid fun with your big, stupid face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to write you this letter to show you how much awesome fun we&#039;re all having here now that you&#039;ve finally put an entire ocean between you and us. Yeah, we&#039;re having tons of funs all over the place like a billion, and most of it is in regards to you getting the H out. We&#039;re always like, 'here&#039;s a toast to that guy Andrew and his no longer being here!' Then everybody gets really quiet for a few minutes, and I try to think about dinosaurs because that&#039;s what I used to do when I was a kid and I was trying not to cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ol&#039; number 3 is still doing well. That weird secondary light in the bathroom has gone out, and we can&#039;t figure out how to take it apart to replace it. We&#039;re going to tell Jonny Bash about it and have him send that skinny dude to fix it, but they&#039;re really busy right now with leasing season. Also, Bash&#039;m just got elected to the County Council, so I kinda don&#039;t want to approach him until that blows over a little bit, because I&#039;m sure he&#039;s got a lot to say about the whole situation. John renewed his lease for next year, which means we don&#039;t have to worry about cleaning up all those labels and marker on the walls and stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I finally bought peanut butter the other day. After over a year since I moved out of my old apartment, I&#039;m out of the stockpile I collected as part of the Meisner Collection. That leaves the footrests and that coffee table thing in my room as the only remaining items that I stole from Dan (well, except for the frying pan, the Foreman grill, that jacket that doesn&#039;t fit me, and that one spoon).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, Harland Fankboner has a new Fresh Idea card. That&#039;s new. Remember that time we went to the store and I bought a whole box of Sweet Tarts Ropes? I haven&#039;t eaten any Sweet Tarts Ropes in like three months. Isn&#039;t that about when you left town? Just look how much healthier I am now that I don&#039;t have your big ol&#039; stanky ass holding me down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Monkeys are going to do a show at IU again this year. I&#039;m really excited for it, even though the email invitation we got and all the documents are made out to Tim Franklin. We&#039;ve got a show with the Ship of Fools on November 22, too. It&#039;s another charity show, this time just for Habitat for Humanity. Joe has been in contact with the charity, and I told him to tell them that if they don&#039;t send some of their people to the show this year, then I&#039;ll just keep all the money for myself. I have to redo the combined logo for the flier for this show, since the Crazy Monkeys have a new logo. We still haven&#039;t cashed that check yet (you know the one I mean). Sorry about that. We&#039;ve had a lot of other stuff to think about, and we&#039;re also pretty lazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#039;t think Joe actually told the Habitat people that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just so you know, I got a catalog today from <em>Things Remembered</em>, that place that engraves people&#039;s names into metal junk. So you and your little friend Andy Briston have gotten me onto somebody&#039;s mailing list. I hope you&#039;re both happy. I&#039;ll probably get these catalogs for the rest of my lonely, sweet-tarts-rope-free life. Just so you know, I could totally snatch a sterling silver heart dangle for $65 with like four whole words engraved on it. I&#039;m going to buy one that says 'Andy Briston died this year.' There&#039;s only a few more weeks in 2008, you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottlecap bucket is pretty much level to the rim, so it&#039;s time to either do something with these or find a larger bucket. I bet we could have found one at Goodwill, but John never wants to go there. Remember that time we got cursed by a gypsy and then you fled the continent, sticking me with it? That gypsy has moved across town into a way nicer house in a way nicer neighborhood (or at least her 'ESP Readings' sign has). She&#039;s doing way better now that she&#039;s gotten rid of the curse. Maybe in Europe you can find some sort of ancient temple that does curse clensings and you can have them do something about it. Maybe you could dig up a cardinal&#039;s bones and perform some sort of ritual or something. You should dig up a cardinal&#039;s bones anyway. It couldn&#039;t hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made a video for my sister a couple weeks ago. You remember when you used to sit on the couch playing Half Life while I was working on projects and stuff? John just sits in his room playing Half Life. It&#039;s not the same. Anyway, I put the video online so you (or any joker who&#039;s reading my totally private letter to you) can see it. It&#039;s pretty hilarious, plus it has Justice in it. If it ever finishes rendering, I&#039;ll put a link up on this website or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#039;s about all I have tonight. Good ol&#039; Friday night. . . Remember when I would be like, 'hey, it&#039;s Friday, let&#039;s go to a bar!' and then you would give me that look like you think I&#039;m a moron, and I would totally play it off like I was kidding and laugh awkwardly for too long, then we&#039;d go back to playing Team Fortress 2? John actually listens to me all the time, and we keep getting stuck at a bar because I didn&#039;t realize that I was just kidding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That new Zombie Team Fortress game is almost out, and I played the demo. It&#039;s pretty sweet, but I probably won&#039;t get it since I don&#039;t have any friends here anymore who&#039;ll play it with me. John just sits at his computer looking up wikipedia stuff in Linux drinking Cosmopolitans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok. Have tons of funs on Europe. Party till you puke and all that. Let me know when you do that thing I asked you to do (not digging up a cardinal; the other thing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>Shauvon</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "title": "Why",
      "text": "<p>I had a thought. Actually I had a few thoughts. If you want to know why I&#039;ve been really out of it lately, or you didn&#039;t know I was out of it and just wanted to know what was going through my mind, here&#039;s your answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you&#039;ll have to forgive me for answering your question with a question.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Why am I here?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Why am I here?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s the question that occupies most of my mind lately. I don&#039;t mean it on a cosmic, \r\n\r\nmeaning of life sort of level. Just, 'what for?' Why am I working here? Why am I at Purdue? \r\n\r\nWhy am I getting out of bed? I&#039;ve been really struggling with the 'what for' of \r\n\r\neverything. (bear with me, this does go somewhere)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I see it, life is a series of horrible events, strung together by periods of \r\n\r\nrelative calm. Something terrible happens, either to me or the world around me. I deal with \r\n\r\nit, and it blows over ('events always have a way of working out'). I feel bad about the \r\n\r\nterrible thing that happened for a while (or I am otherwise affected by it). Time pushes \r\n\r\nthose memories back, and they ultimately slip away. I calm down; I forget. Life moves on, and \r\n\r\nI&#039;m left to wait for the next crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be fine if those crisis points were balanced out, if every once in a while \r\n\r\nsomething really awesome happened to me. I don&#039;t have good things. I don&#039;t catch a break. All \r\n\r\nI get is neutral - periods of relative calm with which to catch my breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an example. A couple weeks ago, I came down with a nasty stomach flu. I don&#039;t know \r\n\r\nwhat it was, and I don&#039;t care. All I care about is the fact that it made me throw up all \r\n\r\nnight. If you know me at all, you should know that I have a pathological hatred of vomit. I \r\n\r\nhate talking about it. I hate hearing about it. There is absolutely nothing that I consider \r\n\r\nworse. I would rather lose a limb. <em>I would rather die.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melodrama aside, the event crippled me. I was ready to come back to school (it was right \r\n\r\nat the end of the semester break), and have a great last semester. Instead, now I&#039;m just \r\n\r\nliving in fear of the next crisis. Every time I wake up in a cold sweat, because I heard my \r\n\r\nroommate go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, every time my stomach feels upset, \r\n\r\nevery time I eat anything, I can&#039;t help but wonder if the time has come again. Did John catch \r\n\r\nsomething? Did I catch it, too? Will this bite be the one that makes me sick? It could happen \r\n\r\nany day, at absolutely any point, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to stop it. Worse \r\n\r\nstill is the knowledge that it <em>will</em> happen again. It is inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Is that all I have to live for?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some day, maybe soon, I will calm down. The memories won&#039;t be so fresh, and I&#039;ll be able \r\n\r\nto close my eyes without thinking about it. Some day I&#039;ll be able to go to sleep without \r\n\r\nwondering how soon I&#039;ll be woken up by nausea. On that day, when I finally forget, is when it \r\n\r\nwill happen again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Is that all I have to live for?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever actually produce my pilot (in fact, I really doubt it). I \r\n\r\ndon&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever fall in love. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever be able to build a computer \r\n\r\nthat doesn&#039;t constantly crash. I don&#039;t know what kind of job I will be getting in a couple \r\n\r\nmonths when I graduate. I have no idea when, or <em>if</em> anything good will ever happen to \r\n\r\nme, but I do know that something bad <em>will</em>. It may not be vomiting. It could be my \r\n\r\ncomputer completely failing (or crashing while I&#039;m working on something really important). It \r\n\r\ncould be yet another person breaking my heart. It could be a Crazy Monkey show that I work \r\n\r\nhard on that turns out terribly. It could be one of a billion things that I couldn&#039;t possibly \r\n\r\nimagine. I don&#039;t know what bad thing will happen to me, but I do know that it will \r\n\r\nhappen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Is that all I have to live for?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all I care about is just not vomiting (or whatever), why should I do anything? The more \r\n\r\nI&#039;m in contact with people, the more I put myself at risk of catching something (or having my \r\n\r\nheart broken). If I don&#039;t care about getting a job (I&#039;m really not sure that I am), when why \r\n\r\ndo it? If I know all I will get out of class today is boredom, why should I go? If I don&#039;t \r\n\r\nthink my pilot will ever be made, and I&#039;m sure nobody will ever care (including myself), why \r\n\r\nshould I work on it? Why not just sit around all day working on <a href='http://www.thecrazymonkeys.com/improv/'>Stupid, Useless Crap</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s you: 'You dwell on the negative, Shauvon.' That&#039;s the point I&#039;m trying to make. \r\n\r\nWhen a crisis happens, we all dwell on the negative. We have to look at what&#039;s going wrong so \r\n\r\nwe can do something to fix it. Then, when things are back to a status quo, we can forget it. \r\n\r\nWe can fall back into our ignorance, and ignore how horrible the universe is. I can&#039;t do \r\n\r\nthat. I refuse to ignore what&#039;s wrong. I refuse because I <em>need</em> to know what&#039;s wrong. \r\n\r\nI need to know <em>why</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could return to my life of contented ignorance, silently waiting for the next life-\r\n\r\naltering crisis. I could work on my pilot. I could do my homework. I could, but then I would \r\n\r\nlose everything. I can&#039;t let go, because I need an answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Why am I here?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has to be an answer to that question, because I <em>am</em> here. I&#039;m out of bed. I \r\n\r\nwent to class. I&#039;m still thinking about ideas for my pilot. I ate something. I almost said \r\n\r\nsomething to a cute girl who sat next to me. Something is driving me, and I can&#039;t - <em>I \r\n\r\ncan&#039;t</em> let go until I figure out what that is. I can&#039;t let go of this screaming \r\n\r\ndesperation, this raging fear, until I have an answer. I can&#039;t embrace the ignorance again \r\n\r\nuntil I know why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourselves, now. Why are you here? Put your hands down, that&#039;s rhetorical. I&#039;m just \r\n\r\nsaying, it&#039;s something you should know. Why do you get out of bed? Why do you risk getting \r\n\r\nsick every single moment of your lives? Maybe you don&#039;t need one (probably because you \r\n\r\nhaven&#039;t had any crises lately). Maybe I&#039;m the only person who needs a reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Why am I here?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Why not?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ll leave you with the lyrics to a Nine Inch Nails song, <em>Getting Smaller</em> \r\n\r\n(because nobody understands an existential crisis like Trent Reznor). The song came up on my headphones, and it inspired me to come up with this whole diatribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nGetting a little erratic here\r\nAnd I don&#039;t know who to trust\r\nI guess they got a way of reading my mind\r\nI guess I gotta adjust\r\nGot my arms they flip flop flip flop flip\r\nGot my head on a spring\r\nWell I thought I got you on my side\r\nI haven&#039;t got fucking anything\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just a face in the crowd\r\nNothing to worry about\r\nNot even trying to stand out\r\nI&#039;m getting smaller and smaller and smaller\r\nAnd I have nothing to say\r\nIt&#039;s all been taken away\r\nI just behave and obey\r\nI&#039;m afraid I am starting to fade away\r\n\r\nI cannot see through the cracks\r\nWhen I&#039;m pressed up on the wall\r\nI&#039;m not looking to stand up real high\r\nI&#039;d be happy to crawl\r\nI think I&#039;m losing my grip\r\nBut I can still make a fist\r\nYou know I still got my one good arm\r\nThat I can beat...\r\nI can beat myself up with!\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just a face in the crowd\r\nNothing to worry about\r\nNot even trying to stand out\r\nI&#039;m getting smaller\r\nAnd smaller and smaller\r\nAnd I have nothing to say\r\nIts all been taken away\r\nI just behave and obey\r\nI&#039;m afraid I am starting to fade away\r\n\r\nAnd for what it is worth\r\nI really used to believe\r\nThat maybe there&#039;s some great thing\r\nThat we could achieve\r\nAnd now I cant tell the difference\r\nDon&#039;t know what to feel\r\nBetween what I&#039;ve been trying so hard to see\r\nAnd what appears to be real\r\n\r\nFading away\r\nFading away\r\nFading away\r\nFading away\r\n\r\nMy world is getting smaller everyday\r\nMy world is getting smaller everyday\r\n(and that&#039;s okay)\r\n\r\nMy world is getting smaller everyday\r\nMy world is getting smaller everyday\r\n(and that&#039;s okay)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Until next time.</p>\r\n",

You wish you were six eight.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Free shit.</strong><br />\r\nI won&#039;t tell you what or how, just in case somebody wants to arrest me (probably from jealousy), but I <b>C</b>an get a lot of really expen<b>S</b>ive things <b>4</b> free.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Web development is like play</strong><br />\r\nI really enjoy putting an application together, which is why I do it on average for 6 hours a day. Since I consider it more like playing a video game than doing work, I really only do like 2 hours of work a day, and most of that is going to or from class. Oh, also I get paid to do it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>No obligations to man or machine</strong><br />\r\nI have a part time job, a few modest bills every month, and two pretty easy classes (see #1). Those are the only minor obligations I have. I ask myself <em>why</em> I should get out of bed every morning because I don&#039;t <em>have</em> to get out of bed. I ask 'why am I here?' because I don&#039;t have to be here.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Social Detachment</strong><br />\r\nI feel alienated and isolated from everyone around me, but I prefer it this way. It really sucks sometimes, sure, but you have no idea how freeing it is to be completely detached from everyone around you. I don&#039;t have to follow anybody&#039;s rules (except the government, with the exception of #3).</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>The soundtrack rocks</strong><br />\r\nListen to what I listen to almost constantly, as loudly as I listen to it, and you&#039;ll be ready to punch cars out of your way and smash down walls.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Healthy and chemically pure</strong><br />\r\nExcept for the lung thing (which is really only enough of a problem to be a conversation piece), and the obvious psychological hurdles, I&#039;ve never had a serious health problem. Also, barely any drugs ever enter my system, and the ones that do aren&#039;t any more powerful than anti-histamines.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Tim, John, Mike, Tom, Logan, Joe, Eli, Kelsey, Lauren, Matt</strong><br />\r\nI know, you have cool friends, too. Well fuck you and your friends. Mine are better. I sincerely believe that. Last Friday evening, a room full of people all decided that they would rather watch me and my friends than you and yours (unless you&#039;re one of those people I listed, in which case you are one of my friends (and yes, I realize that there were other shows and things going on that night that had audiences, but whatever)). I get to watch the Crazy Monkeys perform pretty much every day.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>My computer(s)</strong><br />\r\nSure, my desktop crashes occasionally, but it&#039;s a quad core machine with 8 gigabytes of ram and DirectX 10.1 capability and a TERRORbyte of hard drive space. Plus it has Vista on it, which is better than anything you might be using. Also, my Eee is better than your laptop.</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There you go, the top ten reasons you wish you were me. I&#039;m just saying this to make sure that we&#039;re clear. I might have trouble motivating myself and understanding what my place is, but there is nobody I would rather be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess I should also mention that I was inspired to do this by one of those disgusting Facebook chain letter things.</p>",

My life is ending on May 9th, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s when my last class happens, a final for Physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On may 11th (the 10th is a Sunday), I begin the 'rest of my life.' Working every single day, all day, until I die. I might take a break on my birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After May 9th, 2009, everything I know will change. Well, okay, so my lease will continue through August, and my job will remain indefinitely, but the point is that my life as I know it will be done. Yes, I will miss it, but judging from how generally unhappy I am most of the time, I shouldn&#039;t mourn for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which, I&#039;ve been especially unhappy lately. It&#039;s (that&#039;s 'it was') my last Spring Break ever, and I failed my goal of seeing at least one boob. My pilot hit a wall (in my head), and I completely lost interest in producing it. I&#039;ve lost touch with reason. I feel like I have no point. I can&#039;t say anything that hasn&#039;t already been said. I can&#039;t do anything that hasn&#039;t already been done. Plus, you know, my life is going to end in a couple months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My problem is that I can&#039;t think of a single thing that I really want to do. There are things I&#039;m mildly interested in, a lot of stuff I like to do to kill time, but nothing I would want to do every day from now until the end of time. That&#039;s been really bumming me out. Especially since five months from now I&#039;ll be homeless, and jobless, on top of being directionless and careless. That&#039;s terrifying on top of depressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel better now, though. I feel better because I&#039;ve pushed the 'end of life as I know it' back a bit. I found something that I want to do. Instead of fear the 'end of my life' I&#039;m going to bring it on. I&#039;m going to just let it all go. I&#039;m going to say goodbye to my life, and I&#039;m going to leave. I will walk straight into the abyss, and I won&#039;t be coming back. I mean, this <em>me</em> won&#039;t be coming back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve never done anything particularly hard. I&#039;ve never done anything particularly interesting, frankly. Before I get a real job and spend the rest of my life building websites or whatever else I&#039;ll be stuck doing, I&#039;m going to have one real adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m going to Burning Man.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

I figured I would mention that in case you&#039;re my parents or you live under a rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, by 'new layout' I mean that they slightly re-designed the home page, which is just a center for pertinent information. Who befriended whom, who says what about which, and et cetera. They redesign it once or twice a year. Every single time they do, the new layout is met with such a barrage of negative criticism, you&#039;d think a Republican was just elected president again. Of course, by 'negative criticism' I mean mostly cursing in all caps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somebody decided to start a vote this time around to see who liked the new layout. As of now, the application has 80,505 votes for the new layout and 1,234,926 votes against. (or as I like to say it, 80,505 intelligent people and 1,234,926 morons). People are still voting because they think it will make a difference. Facebook neither made the application nor do they care what the outcome of the vote is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other thing that people are still doing is commenting on the voting application&#039;s message board. Here are some highlights of those comments, along with my reasons why they&#039;re morons.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/1.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>So the second, third, or fourth layouts are fine? I think the first layout wasn&#039;t great, either, but who can remember <em>six years ago</em>? Also, who doesn&#039;t like black text on a white background? You probably shouldn&#039;t read any books. You&#039;re right, though, <a href='http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=262334249'>Myspace</a> is totally better.</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/2.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>What a valid argument. Or maybe this is just an act of self-censorship.</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/3.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>I&#039;m not sure you get the message behind that book you&#039;re quoting there, Paul.</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/4.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Oh, old people.

For that matter, photos haven&#039;t changed at all, either, except that they now have rounded corners. Ok, so the higher emphasis on 'fan' pages probably just signifies Facebook&#039;s true desire to serve as the world&#039;s greatest advertising platform, but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s what you were getting at. As for why your friends are gone, well maybe it&#039;s because you&#039;re a barely coherent moron.</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/8.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Maybe you should sit down for a moment and take a deep breath.

Also, all five of these people (well, four people and one shoe) thought that just voting 'I do not like the layout' just didn&#039;t quite say 'I do not like the layout' enough for them. Essentially 85% of the comments were something to the effect of 'I do not like the layout.' Thanks, that&#039;s really helpful, shoe.</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/fb/10.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>I am not subject to change!!

As you can probably imagine, I&#039;m pretty bored a lot in Physics Lab, so I spend a lot of time watching them. I just drift off while my lab partner calculates all of the gratuitous calculations, and they happen to be the best thing in the room to look at. Is that creepy? I&#039;m just going to continue as if it&#039;s not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, they could be sitting in a room full of actors from the OC (don&#039;t call it that), and they would still be the best thing in the room to look at. They could be sitting in an art gallery, and they would still be . . . anyway you get the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&#039;re <em>gorgeous</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course I don&#039;t know anything about them, except that they&#039;re friends, <strong title='This is definitely a class for non-majors'>not physics majors</strong>, and <em>perfect</em>. Sure, I&#039;m embellishing a little, just don&#039;t tell them that. Maybe it&#039;s just the content of the class, or the bimbo management students who sit at the next table over from me. Maybe it&#039;s the way the blonde&#039;s golden hair shines in the midday sun, or the brunette&#039;s curt and gentle smile. Maybe it&#039;s just the fact that they are consistently dressed so well for a pointless, 200 level class. Maybe it&#039;s just my nature to fall deeply in like with whomever sits on the other side of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I&#039;m just a creep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It occurred to me today, as I watched the blonde walk across the room to get something from the printer, that these will be the last girls I will admire from across a classroom. I&#039;ve done it constantly since I was six, since even before I started wearing two different colored socks every day. I always see a beautiful woman on the other side of the room, think something poetic and sad about how I&#039;ll never meet them, and then move on to the next class. Sometimes I&#039;ve <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00075'>talked</a> to them, usually I <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00176'>do</a> nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really worth talking to people. Of course, here, I&#039;m referring to people in general. They&#039;re never what I hope they are. They can&#039;t live up to the expectations I unconsciously place on them based only on appearances. At best, they&#039;ll give me something to do for a while, and at worst they&#039;ll cause me a considerable amount of pain and hatred. Ninety-nine out of a hundred people you meet will do nothing but frustrate and annoy you (that&#039;s one of Shauvon McGill&#039;s patent-pending laws of life). I don&#039;t like having to talk to people, but since I am a human being, I have to. It turns out that&#039;s ok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One out of those hundred times, they&#039;ll change your life.</em> Somehow that justifies everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I&#039;ve been doing a lot of 'looking back' at the last five years, thinking about what I should take from it all. Since I am an entirely different person than I was five years ago, I guess the answer is <em>everything</em>. Still, I wonder if these two girls represent my last classroom crush, or my last chance to do the only thing I ever really wanted to do in college. Do I risk ruining the former for the minuscule chance at the latter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, since there are two of them, it&#039;s only a 1 in 50 chance that they&#039;ll break my heart . . . As if there&#039;s any chance at all that I&#039;ll actually talk to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s looking at you, cute Physics Lab girls. You may not be the last girls I admire from the other side of a room, but you&#039;ll be the last girls I admire from the other side of a <em>class</em>room. Thank you for giving me a reason to go to class.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

We ended up using the first and the third one, putting both up all over campus. This flier got Joe and Logan (or Jogan) into the group. Note that the new logo text is fully realized now.

I made a certificate at work which they ended up not using (lame), but I didn&#039;t want it to go to waste so I turned it into this flier (sweet). The picture is from my parents&#039; new woods. Notice the reference to Harland Fankboner and Lookit the Tiny Monkey. This flier got Kelsey, Lauren, Matt, and Eli in to the group, so it was partially successful at getting girls (actually, it tripled the number of girls in the group, so that&#039;s a big win).</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I officially released the new Crazy Monkey logo. I made a new logo for the group for a few reasons. First, I wanted to make an impact and make sure that they never forget me (until someone else re-designs it). Second, and more important, I wanted a logo that was less phallic, arthritic, and hard to draw. The new logo can easily be sketched on a chalkboard or sidewalk. Also, I think it&#039;s neat that the new logo has the letters 'C' and 'M' in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/logo_reg.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Do you see them?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, with the new logo, I threw together some promotional materials for it.

I wished that there was a big media buzz over the new logo, but nobody really cared. I guess these images can stand as a memorial to October, 2008, which wasn&#039;t bad. I did the first three in Photoshop, and the last one in Maya. The middle one was from a photoshoot we did to finally get a group photo which was immediately invalidated by getting a bunch of new members.

I don&#039;t really count it as a flier, though, because it&#039;s the same as the one I had for the first show of the year, just with the new logo 'spray painted' over it.

I really like how this flier turned out, but I was not very impressed with how well the audience turned out. The Ship of Fools told us that they wanted pajamas made out of a material with this pattern on it.

It didn&#039;t really turn out that way, and I&#039;m not really a fan of what I ended up with. This was right in the middle of a pretty serious lull in my photography (which I&#039;m only just getting out of now), so I didn&#039;t have much material to work with. I think it was an interesting idea, but it didn&#039;t really work too well. Vienna isn&#039;t a great place to do a show, FYI.</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/FLIERS/2009_1_23.jpg'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/2009_1_23.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>January, 2009: Then I came back hard. I love this one, and I turned it into a great desktop wallpaper, too (most of these fliers can be downloaded as wallpapers from the monkey website, in the archives). I wanted to prove that I could do shiny gradients and other web 2.0 stuff, and I did just that. This was when I started to realize that the new logo is pretty spindly, though, which I&#039;m not a fan of. I wish the outer border was heavier. By the way, every show we&#039;ve done at Greyhouse has been amazing. The energy in that place is fantastic.</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/FLIERS/2009_3_6.jpg'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/2009_3_6.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>March, 2009: I had the idea that we should try a show at Hot Box pizza, since we were unable to get Matthews all semester, and Greyhouse books all semester in advance. This show turned out okay, and we absolutely packed the place. This flier has the first actual appearance of the full text + graphic logo. I wish I made the cardboard thing actually look like a pizza box, and not just a weird piece of cardboard. Also, I hope Hot Box doesn&#039;t sue us for stealing their style.</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/FLIERS/2009_4_3.jpg'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/2009_4_3.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>April, 2009: I had the idea a while ago to do a super-show which would take an entire evening, and feature groups doing shows in venues all over town. We only ended up getting one other group, and toned the plan down from five groups in five hours to three groups in three hours. Then I had the idea that if we did a longform show we would have one of every style of live comedy. This was the best comedy show I will probably ever be a part of. This was also the best weekend of my life.</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/FLIERS/2009_4_18.jpg'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/2009_4_18.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>April, 2009: We finally got Big Dog down to do another show, so I made another dog-themed flier. I wish I had made it look like stacks of paper instead of cut out of paper, because using red in the background threw off the illusion. Big Dog is probably the coolest group of dudes ever. Our logo kind of looks like crap on the blue background. I wish I had just used a black and white logo.</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/FLIERS/2009_5_1.jpg'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/FLIERS/2009_5_1.jpg' style='width: 400px; margin: auto; display: block' />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>May, 2009: The last flier I will make for the last official show I will do with the Crazy Monkeys. Like Andrew&#039;s flier last year, I made an homage to this year&#039;s graduates. I don&#039;t know about Tim or Mike, but the symbolism here for me is that I&#039;m walking to Burning Man.

      "title": "CGT 456 Group 3 Report",
      "text": "<p>If you have talked to me in the last two weeks (or looked at my twitter feed), you&#039;ll know that I just finished up a big group project which didn&#039;t quite go so well. I was stuck with idiots who didn&#039;t do any work. Anyway, I had to write a report explaining how much work we all did and what it was like. I just sent mine to the professor, and hopefully it doesn&#039;t get me in trouble. I&#039;ll show it to you. I know, I kind of rip the two dudes a few new ones. I&#039;m only stating fact, and future potential employers might want to know things like 'is completely incompetent' or 'incapable of understanding ASP.NET' about a potential hire, and those things don&#039;t usually make it onto resumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto'>\r\n\r\n<p>To whom it may concern:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am reasonably convinced that my group, group 3, did the absolute worst project in this class. I have looked at a few of the other groups&#039; work. They&#039;re dynamic, flashy, and interesting. Ours looks terrible, is full of bugs, and in many places doesn&#039;t work at all. That isn&#039;t a great way to start a group project report. I just want to preface the whole process with this disclaimer. It&#039;s unfair, you see, to compare our project to the other groups. It&#039;s unfair because the other groups were actually groups. Group 3 was really only one man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did almost all of the work on this project. I say 'almost' because there were a few things the other two group members did which I had to completely redo to make it work right. Who put together the entire class structure? I did that. Who made all of the database interaction? I did that, too. Who built the system for displaying a list of questions, showing the answers, and all of the code to add new questions and answers (which essentially was the entire project)? I did all of it. Who wrote the code to generate a tag cloud and dynamically display it on the page? I wrote that code. Who built all of the ASP.NET panels and wrote the code behind file to sort through them all? You guessed it, it was me. In fact, I feel particularly confident that I was the only member of my group who actually knew how to use ASP.NET or C# in any productive way. I&#039;m not sure why I trusted my group members to handle just turning it in. I was out of town that weekend, so I had no choice. The only way I even knew the other two guys existed was because they were ridiculously annoying and incompetent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the group work well together? We absolutely did not. We didn&#039;t work together at all. I did all the work, and the other two guys sat staring at their screens scratching their heads. Did I have any problems with any members of my group? Absolutely I did. They were morons and they didn&#039;t understand anything. If they had told me afterword that they were, in fact, 15, I would not have been surprised in the least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m not sure how to divide the work load. I would say between the two of them, they did maybe 5% of the overall project (if you don&#039;t count the stuff I had to redo because it didn&#039;t work). Considering the site doesn&#039;t even really work, that&#039;s essentially 5% of nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gabe did the beautiful design. Actually, he just came up with the header; the sidebar was my idea, since we needed a place for, you know, content. He immediately volunteered to design the site, which is something I am still puzzled over. He was preparing his 411 presentation at the time, so obviously he couldn&#039;t actually work on the design for this website until that was over, when all we had time for was the complete pile of trash he came up with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David dealt with the database structure; of course I use the term 'dealt with' very loosely. As far as I know, he just had a friend of his do all the work. Even with a supposed expert SQL Server guru backing us, I still found things missing from the database structure on a daily basis. David also insisted we work on his personal server, instead of the space provided to us by the class. To say this was an inconvenience would be like saying David himself was merely lazy. I had to use the world&#039;s worst FTP software to manually upload every file I changed, and I  had absolutely no access to the SQL Server database to find all of the things that were missing from it. Ultimately I had to make my own page that just dumped out all of the data because I had no other way to view it. The process was slow, annoying, and unnecessary. The biggest frustration came when David decided that we should go ahead and move everything over to the class server anyway (but I could go ahead and keep working on his if I wanted to). At least he thanked me for all of my work almost constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked on this project pretty much straight through for about six days in a row (plus off and on for the two weeks before then). I definitely did more work on this than I did for the first two projects. Unfortunately, it was just too much for one man to finish. I told them I wasn&#039;t going to be able to work on it on Friday evening or Saturday morning, figuring that they could debug anything that wasn&#039;t quite working yet. Of course, that was assuming they knew how ASP.NET worked. I have since checked the site, and of course it&#039;s broken. It worked fine when I stopped working on it on Friday morning, so obviously one of the geniuses thought they could sneak into the garage and start playing around with daddy&#039;s tools. I would be insulted that they even want to keep their names on the thing, but that wouldn&#039;t be fair to them. Sure, I&#039;m responsible for the stuff we got working, but they&#039;re responsible for all the stuff that doesn&#039;t work at all. I guess that entitles them to have equal credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#039;re supposed to say what grade we would give ourselves if we were grading this project. I would give us a 'D,' but only because I still want to pass. My diploma is riding on this a little bit, so it would suck to not graduate just because I was stuck with some idiots. I know one thing for certain, though. David Auble and Gabe Masters-Jackson should not pass this class. They don&#039;t know the first thing about ASP.NET, and they should not be allowed to think that they do (or make employers think they do, for crying out loud). I&#039;m not trying to throw them under the bus to save my own skin. It&#039;s just that I obviously know what I&#039;m doing, and they obviously don&#039;t. That means they should fail, and I should not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should mean that, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope it means that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, cry 'havoc' and let slip the dogs of grading. I can only apologize for the terrible site that you&#039;re forced to wade through to grade it. I&#039;m not making any excuses for anything we didn&#039;t get done. I&#039;m just letting you know that it was a miracle we got anything done at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what it&#039;s worth, you&#039;re by far my favorite professor in CGT. I&#039;m not just saying that. You&#039;re the reason I&#039;m pursuing a career in web development. Thank you, and good luck with the new class you&#039;re teaching next semester. It sounds awesome, and I really wish I could have taken it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nShauvon McGill<br />\r\nsmcgill@purdue.edu\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let this stand as proof that if I posted it on here I probably meant every single word, because I did, and I do.</p>",

      "text": "<p>or <strong>Shauvon Should Not be Allowed to Have Money (part 1)</strong></p><p>I have a new camera. This shouldn&#039;t be news to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a Canon 50D, with a Tamron 18 - 270 mm lens. I have a 4 gigabyte Compact Flash card, and a Canon 430EX speedlight (but the speedlight isn&#039;t new). It&#039;s probably the most awesome thing I&#039;ve ever owned (except maybe that limited-edition signed copy of <em>Ara</em> that I have around here somewhere). The new camera, which I call <em>Carus</em> (a Latin word for 'expensive'), has 15 megapixels. It shoots Canon Raw files that are around 25 megabytes a file. My old camera, a Canon 350D (apparently lower numbers mean better cameras), had 8 megapixels and created files that were about 7 megabytes each. I can take just over 200 pictures on a 2 gigabyte CF card with my old camera. With <em>Carus</em>, using a 4 gig card, I can take about 150 pictures. That&#039;s how much bigger 15 megapixels are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pictures my old camera took were plenty big. With 8 megapixels, you can easily print poster-sized versions of photographs, create desktop backgrounds that span two widescreen monitors, and quickly fill hard drives with pictures. Carus <em>takes photographs with almost twice the resolution and over three times the size of my old camera. <strong>I can substantially crop photographs taken by </em>Carus<em>, and they will still be larger than anything my old camera took.</strong></em> That gives me a great deal of power as a photographer. A 15 megapixel file is 4752 pixels wide by 3168 pixels tall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see just how big that is by looking at <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/15_megapixels.jpg' target='15megapixels'>this 6.51 megabyte JPEG file</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carus is <em>Heavy</em> (its full name is 'Gravis, Ergo Carus' or 'Heavy, therefore Expensive'). When I hold my old camera, it feels like a child&#039;s toy compared to this beast. Aside from making me feel like a real man, Carus&#039;s weight makes it a little difficult to carry around all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve taken a lot of pictures with Carus. You don&#039;t really have to try hard to get pictures substantially better than pictures you would take with a 'sans-carus' camera.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Would you like to see some of them?</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/50D_01.jpg' target='15_megapixels'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/small_50D_01.jpg' class='weekly' />\r\n</a>\r\n<div class='caption'></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/50D_02.jpg' target='15_megapixels'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/small_50D_02.jpg' class='weekly' />\r\n</a>\r\n<div class='caption'></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/50D_03.jpg' target='15_megapixels'>\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/50D-1/small_50D_03.jpg' class='weekly' />\r\n</a>\r\n<div class='caption'>My new, powerful lens allows me to capture small, easily scared things from a distance.

      "text": "<p>I live in Chicago, now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something I&#039;m getting used to is having the comic book store considerably farther away. It means I make much less impulse purchasing of cool comics, or I at least have to coordinate them around my once-a-week trip to that part of the neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the other difficult things about being a person with only two arms and zero cars in a big city is buying groceries. Of course, the big city does mean I have a few options (although I&#039;m still looking for a great little greek-owned food mart somewhere).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very recently, a Jewel Osco (the chain of Supermarket here) closed right around the corner from my place while they build a new one. A shiny new Jewel will be opening in the fall of 2010, but that does me little good now. The nearest Jewel is now about seven tenths of a mile away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also about seven tenths of a mile away is a cool supermarket called Trader Joe&#039;s. Joe runs a pretty trendy little mart, with lots of organic food and other hipster gear. Hipsters don&#039;t like brand names, so Joe&#039;s got his own. You&#039;re not going to find Nabisco, Kellog&#039;s, or Kraft here (well, you might, but it isn&#039;t as prevalent). Yes, it&#039;s a store without Kraft Foods. My <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00164'>boycott</a> just got a lot easier. Joe&#039;s got a whole aisle of this super trendy stuff called 'wine.' He may call himself a trader, but he primarily just trades wine for cash. I doubt they would accept an old pair of pants for a box of cereal, or this old hard drive I have laying around for a watermelon. Joe is, in fact, a poor trader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closer, at four tenths of a mile, is the nearest CVS pharmacy. I know it&#039;s a pharmacy and not a food-mart-cy, but they have essentials like ice cream, cereal, candy, and more of that 'wine' stuff (plus plenty of drugs). Also, they have brand names, which means Oreo cookies. My <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00164'>boycott</a> once again meets challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closer still, at three tenths of a mile, is a store called Whole Foods Market. I think they&#039;re implying that other stores only sell you like eight-tenths of an apple or cheese with extra holes or something. At least they&#039;re upfront about what kind of store they are. Namely, a store kind of store. I&#039;m less tempted to try to barter with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, in case you were wondering, the distance from ol&#039; 248 S. Chauncey #3 (my old apartment) to the Purdue Union was only three tenths of a mile. From 248 S. Chauncey #3 to La Village food mart was only one tenth of a mile. I am now farther from food and other trendy hipster amenities than I used to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being the closest superfoodorium, I went to Whole Foods today to see what it was all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all about the Benjamins.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Read More</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>or Shauvon no longer has any money.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_014.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m sorry about the poor image quality in these photographs. I only had my cell phone with me. I just noticed the Range Rover in the foreground of that picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing you notice about Whole Foods is how overwhelmingly full of itself it is. Connoisseur beer piled right inside the front door?  Aisles of organic groceries piled on wooden shelves? Antipasto bar? Accessories like two-bottle rubber wine caddies hanging at the end of aisles? General aroma of fine cheese? This place has it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, though, once you get used to it, Whole foods is just like any Marsh or Kroger that I&#039;m used to (those are what they call supermarkets back where I&#039;m from, in the middle of nowhere). Just replace the Connoisseur beer with Bud Light, the organic groceries with moth-infested processed corporate human chow, the wooden shelves with monolithic, cold steel, mile-long shelves, the antipasto with cheese wiz, the wine caddies with NFL branded beer cozies, and the fine cheese smell with a mixture of rotting produce and fat sweat, and you&#039;ve got yourself a Kroger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously I&#039;m exaggerating a little. Sometimes they have Miller High Life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, though, I&#039;m much more comfortable at a place like Kroger or Marsh. Probably, I suppose, because I&#039;m used to places like that. The Whole Foods was very new, and like most things I encounter here, wholly terrifying. At one point I realized I was actually lost inside the store. I was lost and scared in a maze of wooden shelves and bland, beige food packages when I began to realize that Whole Foods was an entirely different sort of store. Whole Foods is not a Supermarket. It is, in fact, a <em>Market</em>, and it makes you wonder just what is so super about a Supermarket. They don&#039;t just have an antipasto bar, they have a place where you can sit, relax, and eat your antipasto (or presumably anything else you bought) right there in the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_011.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>The produce and fresh meat selection was extraordinary. Truly, Kroger does not sell ground Bison.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_012.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>They had cups of fresh berries which looked absolutely unforgettable (in fact, between going there and writing this, I purchased and ate most of one of them, and I can assure you that it was fantastic).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_007.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, where else can you buy cheese the size of a case of beer?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_009.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>And just look at the deli section. Everything looked way better than the generic 'slop salad' you&#039;d find at any Kroger or Marsh deli.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wholefoods/small_IMAGE_010.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>Also, and I didn&#039;t get a picture of this, they have Almond Milk. Yes, it&#039;s pretty much what it sounds like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whole Foods certainly seems like the sort of place that is far healthier for you to shop than other, more 'super' markets. Sure, Organic food is pretentious (just look at how I have to capitalize it!), but you can&#039;t deny that it at least <em>seems</em> healthier than all that corporate human-chow. Ultimately, that&#039;s the real point, though. Whole Foods certainly <em><strong>seems</strong></em> like it is a much better place for you to shop. Perhaps it is, but there is definitely a cost for that sense of 'super'-iority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, you&#039;re paying a premium for the sort of place that Whole Foods Market is. When you walk into a place as pretentious as Whole Foods, in your mind you slowly begin to replace the word 'pretentious' with 'goddamned expensive.' Ultimately, those two things are synonyms. Just how much were those berries? Ten dollars a pound (and each cup was about a pound). Ground Bison is $5.99 a pound. A very small box of (non-Kellog&#039;s) cereal is $3.69. A half-gallon of 2% is $2.39 (some prices aren&#039;t terrible, but you&#039;re not going to find any deals). The Almond Milk is two 30 ounce boxes for $4 (It comes in a juice box thing, and it doesn&#039;t require refrigeration. I&#039;m so intrigued I might have to go back and buy some). A box with two small frozen pizzas is $4.99.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A woman finally asked me why I was taking pictures and notes on my cell phone, so I started to feel bad about not buying anything. I told her I was just interested in the place and wanted to tell my mom about it, so if you aren&#039;t my mom, don&#039;t read this. You hear me? <strong>This article is only for my mom.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I went ahead and got a few things that I needed (like milk, bread, frozen pizzas, gluten-free waffles, and fresh fruit). I just got one basket, which turned out to be only one paper grocery bag full of food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just one bagful of pretentious, gluten free, organic, delicious, and admittedly cool, food. Any guesses how much the total was?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>$48.11</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost $50 for just one bag full of odds and sods (I&#039;ve been watching a lot of British TV). How much food can you buy at Kroger for $50? How much is one basketful of food at Marsh? Certainly not $50. I used to feel bad when a basket of food at La Village (only one tenth of a mile from my home) came to $25. Is the quality of life that Whole Foods allows you worth the added cost? These are not necessarily rhetorical questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other day, I was walking down the alley behind my apartment and was passed by one of my neighbors parking his Audi A6 in his garage next to his Maserati. I suppose he (or the guy with the Range Rover in the picture up above) doesn&#039;t mind spending that much for food (he probably feeds ground Bison to his dog). I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m cool with it, though. I&#039;d rather just buy comic books.</p>",

I don&#039;t like keeping a 'blog' because I don&#039;t think people really care about my personal problems. I want this site to be an interesting exploration of human culture and a place for me to explore my viewpoint on life. Hopefully my unique perspective is entertaining and insightful to somebody. That is my ultimate goal for this site, to provide something interesting for somebody to read. If I can help someone avoid a bad decision, or brighten someone&#039;s day with my mis-adventures, then I believe this site will be a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With moving to Chicago, I think my life has become considerably more interesting to an outside observer. Every time I told someone I was moving here, they seemed to be somewhat jealous of me and my exploits. Of course, all I felt was extreme fear, but that&#039;s another story. The thing is, I&#039;m not sure what adventures I should try to get in to up here. Therefore, for the next year of my life, and by extension the next year of DenyConformity.com, I want to commission your help. Help me make this site as good as it can be.

      "text": "<p>I&#039;m currently trying to get a chance to see a thunderstorm from the top of the building formerly known as the Sears Tower. Someone recently <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00230'>asked</a> me to try to do this. I&#039;ve made a little progress, and I thought I&#039;d let you know what I&#039;ve discovered so far. I wanted to update you all as soon as possible to let you know that I will, in fact, actually try to do things that you <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00230'>ask</a> me to do.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Read more</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Is it possible to see a thunderstorm from the top of the Sears Tower?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with, I thought I&#039;d give a little history on the Sears Tower. Of course, you could just go to Wikipedia (which I am doing) and read all you want, but I&#039;ll give you the highlights. The Sears Tower is 108 stories or 1,450 feet tall. It is the tallest building in the United States (and was the tallest in the world for a while). It is currently the fifth tallest phalli - er - <em>structure</em> in the world. Sears actually lost their naming rights in 2003, but it continued to be called the Sears tower until recently, when some company called Willis something or other bought a bunch of the building and demanded to change the name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many groups on Facebook angry about the name change that people have started making groups angry about all the groups angry about the name change. That&#039;s how angry the internet is about the name change. How angry are you?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/willie/willis_facebook.jpg'>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I think it&#039;s great. I mean, it&#039;s always been a giant willie, so now we can actually call it that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I think it&#039;s interesting that Sears never actually fully utilized the building, leaving it mostly vacant until the mid 90&#039;s, when it was sold it to somebody else. 'They&#039;re' also planning on painting it silver, which I suppose would make it much easier to keep cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The observation, or 'Sky-' deck opened in 1974, and it&#039;s on the 103rd floor of the building. I don&#039;t know who&#039;s office is in the 108th floor, but he&#039;s probably one of the coolest people in the world (let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s almost certainly not a woman). On a clear day, you can see Indiana from the Skydeck. The observation deck in the John Hancock building (which used to be the most phallic name for a building) is 323 feet lower. In January, 'they' opened up a few glass bottomed balconies which extend out of the Willis Tower, and give you the sensation that you&#039;re floating 103 stories up. They sound pretty awesome, and I will try to get some pictures of them in the next week or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It costs $14.95 for a regular adult ticket to the Skydeck. The deck is open every day from 9 AM to 10 PM. They probably start kicking people out at 9:50, because they&#039;re tired and want to go home. I presume that working at the top of Big Willie would diminish most of the novelty of the thing. I went to the Skydeck once with a school trip at night. It was pretty neat, but I bet on a clear day it would be even more neat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about during a thunderstorm?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve seen Big Willie completely cloaked in clouds before, and I&#039;m sure when cloud cover is relatively low (in altitude, not quantity) the view isn&#039;t so great. It&#039;s probably still pretty interesting, but you probably can&#039;t even see the ground, let alone Indiana. If atmospheric conditions are just right, though, it certainly would be spectacular to see a thunderstorm from one of those little glass balconies. It seems like it would be quite a show, but it also seems like the sort of thing 'they' wouldn&#039;t let you do, for safety reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My good friend Lili emailed one of 'them' and asked if the Skydeck was open during thunderstorms. Mirian Vasquez of Skydeck Chicago responded by saying, 'Thank you for your interest in the Skydeck. Guests are definitely allowed on the Skydeck during thunderstorms. The view might not be so great though, since storms bring thick, dark, clouds. I hope this answers your questions!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, thank you, Mirian, that certainly does answer some questions. Apparently it <em>is</em> possible to see a thunderstorm from the top of the Sears Tower, with a few caveats. First, you can&#039;t go to the <em>top</em> of the tower, because the Skydeck is on the 103rd floor. Second, you might not actually <em>see</em> anything, because the tower could be engulfed in clouds. Third, you&#039;ll have to pay $15, and the thunderstorm will have to be before 10PM. Finally, you technically can&#039;t actually see a thunderstorm from the <em>Sears Tower</em>, because it has been renamed the <em>Willis Tower</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully that sheds some light on the whole idea, and gives you some insight into what it might actually be like. Only time will tell for sure how well it will actually work out, though. I&#039;ll have to keep my eyes on the forecast. The skies are clear tonight, and for the near future, so we&#039;ll just have to wait for the next big storm . . .</p>",

      "text": "<p>Dear Visa and Chase Bank,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently made a purchase from a website called Newegg.com. You probably aren&#039;t really \r\n\r\naware they exist, but they probably receive hundreds if not thousands of charges (from Visa \r\n\r\ncards) every day for sweet electronic and computer bits. I tried to be one of those lucky \r\n\r\npeople this morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, I moved recently, and so I have a new computer desk. The keyboard shelf I am now \r\n\r\nusing is slightly smaller than I would like. Because I have too much money as it is, I decided \r\n\r\nto go ahead and buy a new, shorter keyboard to give my mouse more room to move about on my \r\n\r\ndesk. Newegg.com, being the best place to buy computer bits, was the perfect place to shop for \r\n\r\na keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet is supposed to be a magical world where anything is possible, and anything you \r\n\r\ncould possibly dream of can be right at 'your' fingertips (I put 'your' in quotes because I \r\n\r\nrealize that I&#039;m currently speaking to a corporate entity with no real individual identity, \r\n\r\nplus 'you' probably don&#039;t really have much desire for things like keyboards). As a young man \r\n\r\nin my early twenties, I have made hundreds, if not thousands, of purchases online for \r\n\r\neverything from sweet computer bits to train tickets to tonight&#039;s dinner. In fact, I have \r\n\r\nspent almost $8,000 on Newegg.com alone since June, 2004. I feel, as a young man in my early \r\n\r\ntwenties, that the internet truly is 'my oyster' and there is nothing I cannot accomplish \r\n\r\nusing this glorious series of tubes. In short, I am highly competent with exactly this sort of \r\n\r\ntask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least, that&#039;s what I thought until I got a Visa Debit card from Chase Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realize that the presence of nefarious ne&#039;er-do-wells presents the necessity for \r\n\r\nincreased security and 'digital paranoia' (I just made that term up and I think it&#039;s pretty \r\n\r\ngreat). I acknowledge the concept that paying my bills online will forever be a painfully \r\n\r\nfrustrating and bizarrely complicated process (I really don&#039;t care that much if someone wants \r\n\r\nto hack into my electricity account and pay my bill for me, but whatever). Paying bills is \r\n\r\ncomplicated, but it isn&#039;t impossible. I have to repeatedly check my email to recover passwords \r\n\r\nI only use once a month (at best), and answer security questions that I usually make fake \r\n\r\nanswers to anyway. Eventually, the process is done, and my electricity remains on for another \r\n\r\nfew weeks. Still, this process pales in comparison to the 'Verified by Visa' process that you \r\n\r\nsubject your customers to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon placing my order today (on a website upon which I have placed many orders in the past \r\n\r\nwithout problem), I was directed to a page with a little box on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/visa/visa1.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve seen the 'Verified by Visa' process before, so my heart sank as I realized this order \r\n\r\nwasn&#039;t going to be as easy as I was hoping (or as easy as the bike helmet I just bought from \r\n\r\nAmazon (hopefully you&#039;ve heard of them) with the exact same card, which simply required me to \r\n\r\npick a billing and shipping address). I tried a few passwords, trying to remember the one I \r\n\r\nwould have created for myself on that mysterious day that I supposedly created a 'Verified by \r\n\r\nVisa' account. None of them worked. After a few failed attempts, you decided to stop letting \r\n\r\nme try.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/visa/visa2.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>It might be worth noting at this point that I have, as a matter of fact, never actually \r\n\r\ncreated a 'Verified by Visa' account. I know this because you eventually told me so. This \r\n\r\nmakes it difficult to remember my password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The (seemingly) handy link implying that I could generate a new password for myself served \r\n\r\nonly to tell me that I didn&#039;t have an account, so I couldn&#039;t generate a new password. This is \r\n\r\nnot the most helpful thing to read. It is, in fact, the type of thing that upon reading causes \r\n\r\none&#039;s mind to turn quite quickly to thoughts of murder-suicide (preferably involving as many \r\n\r\nmembers of the Visa brain-trust as possible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I knew that my only recourse was to call the phone number that was presented \r\n\r\nto me. All I wanted was my goddamn keyboard. I was not stealing anybody&#039;s identity, nor has \r\n\r\nanybody ever stolen mine, but I still had to be punished for it. Thank you, Visa, for having \r\n\r\nso much faith in your <em>own</em> system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The automated compu-lady that greeted me on the phone offered no option to 'just order my \r\n\r\ngoddamn keyboard' so I picked a few choices that sounded like they would get me to a human \r\n\r\nbeing as quickly as possible. I had to enter the last four digits of my card number, so I \r\n\r\nentered the last four digits of the debit card I was trying to place the order on (the card \r\n\r\nthat sparked this whole debacle in the first place). Compu-lady explained that I was incorrect \r\n\r\n(she obviously knew more about the card I was looking at than I did). I guess she didn&#039;t care \r\n\r\nabout my card anymore, because she asked for my zip code. I gave her the zip code for my \r\n\r\naddress here in Chicago (the address I promptly changed all of my banking information to). \r\n\r\nAgain, I was wrong. This electro-broad obviously knew much more about me than I did. I tried \r\n\r\nmy old, Lafayette, zip code, and it appeared to satisfy the compu-lady&#039;s (misinformed) \r\n\r\nobsession with me. She then asked me for the last four digits of my social security number, \r\n\r\nwhich I entered without problem. We had finally agreed on something. Mechano-girl put me on \r\n\r\nhold.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I was, of course, repeatedly assured that the call would be monitored. I realize this is \r\n\r\nsupposed to make me feel better, but it definitely does not. Why am I waiting for someone to \r\n\r\npick up my call when you repeatedly tell me that someone else is already listening to me? I \r\n\r\nended up on hold for over ten minutes, until someone (else) finally picked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Welcome to Card Services, can I have your name, please?' the man asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Shauvon McGill,' I replied. Asking my name is a simple identity verification. Nobody else \r\n\r\ncould possibly know that information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, Mr. McGill, how can I help you today?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I am trying to make an online purchase and I guess I don&#039;t know my password,' I told \r\n\r\nhim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, let me forward you to someone with online services.'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was placed back on hold. At this point, if anybody was, in fact, monitoring my call, they \r\n\r\nwere subjected to a slurry of foul language. I am deeply sorry for any trouble I caused to \r\n\r\nyour spy department having to listen to my uncontrollable, raging frustration. I regret that \r\n\r\nit was generally un-creative, too, so it wouldn&#039;t even have been that interesting to listen \r\n\r\nto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a woman picked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Welcome to Card Services, can I have your name, please?' the woman asked. Note that \r\n\r\nabsolutely nothing was different between the first and second agents, other than the fact that \r\n\r\nthe second one was a woman and the first was a man. Apparently one could help me and the other \r\n\r\ncould not (although it turns out that neither could actually help me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Shauvon McGill,' I replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, Mr. McGill, how can I help you today?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I am trying to make an online purchase and I guess I don&#039;t know my password,' I told her, \r\n\r\nthrough gritted teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, I can help you with that. Let me just pull up your information.' This surprised me. \r\n\r\nUp to this point, the only information she would have had was the (wrong) zip code that \r\n\r\ncompu-lady got from me, the last four digits of my social security number, and my name, which \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure they would not be able to spell without thorough coaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Is this for the card ending in XXXX?' She asked. It was not, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'It&#039;s not, actually,' I replied. Perhaps we had reached the source of the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Are you trying to use your Chase Visa Credit Card?' she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'It&#039;s my Chase Visa Debit Card.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that I was talking to the 'Credit Card Services' department, and that it was \r\n\r\nthe entirely wrong department to talk to about my debit card. I told her that this was silly \r\n\r\n(which was not exactly the word I used, to be honest), because this was the number I was \r\n\r\ndirected to call after using this very debit card. I would have to use my Chase Visa Credit \r\n\r\nCard to set up a 'Verified by Visa' account, and the human-lady directed me to \r\n\r\n'verifiedbyvisa.com' where I could set up a new account (by the way, this would have been a \r\n\r\ngreat piece of advice to give me from the very beginning, instead of a 'generate new password' \r\n\r\nlink which didn&#039;t actually do anything). For some reason, the Verified by Visa website \r\n\r\nwouldn&#039;t open, because nothing ever works right when I try to use it, so I couldn&#039;t set up a \r\n\r\nnew account. The human-lady offered to redirect me to technical support, and I told her I just \r\n\r\nwanted my goddamn keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was so frustrated at this point that I told the agent I was just going to forget the \r\n\r\nwhole thing and do something else (such as buy a keyboard from Amazon). I apologized for the \r\n\r\nlanguage I used and acknowledged that none of this was her fault, and then I hung up. I clicked \r\n\r\nthe 'cancel' link on the 'Verified by Visa' password box, and I was redirected back to \r\n\r\nNewegg.com&#039;s checkout process. Then I was rather surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was surprised, you see, because I was looking at an order confirmation. I had to check my \r\n\r\norder history to be sure, and make sure I had gotten a confirmation email from Newegg, but it \r\n\r\nwas true. My order was completed successfully. In spite of not being 'Verified by Visa,' it \r\n\r\nwas successfully charged anyway. 'Oh,' I thought, 'well, whatever.' I had finally ordered my \r\n\r\ngoddamn keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope at this point you have noticed some glaring problems with your entire process, but \r\n\r\njust to be clear, let&#039;s go over a few points. First, you sent me on a perilous quest to have \r\n\r\ncontrol of my own money based on a credit card that I wasn&#039;t even using. You see, I wanted to \r\n\r\njust order this goddamn keyboard with the money in my checking account, which is curiously why \r\n\r\nI decided to use my debit card instead of my credit card. You decided that I was using my \r\n\r\ncredit card anyway. This is why I didn&#039;t actually have an account, and I was therefore unable \r\n\r\nto actually 'verify by Visa.' I would hope, as one of the most powerful money laundering \r\n\r\ncorporations in the world, you understand the difference between 'credit' and 'debit.' Perhaps \r\n\r\nyou should take a look at an economics textbook (which, incidentally, Amazon recommends that I \r\n\r\nbuy because I bought one once).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the phone number you told me to call was just a general account information number, \r\n\r\nnot in any way designed to assist me with 'Verified by Visa.' I was forced to have someone \r\n\r\nmanually redirect me to where I needed to go (which was not actually where I needed to go). \r\n\r\nPerhaps if you had electro-broad simply explain that anyone having difficulty with 'Verified \r\n\r\nby Visa' was probably best off just placing their order through paypal (or switching to Master \r\n\r\nCard), you could alleviate much of your call congestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, even though you seem to be in pretty serious 'cahoots' with Chase bank, you don&#039;t \r\n\r\nseem to have gotten the memo that I have changed my billing address zip code. Secure systems \r\n\r\ndon&#039;t work if you don&#039;t actually update them when I change my information. It isn&#039;t identity \r\n\r\ntheft if I know more about my life than you do, Visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, probably the biggest problem with this system is the fact that after I failed to \r\n\r\nlog in and was locked out of my (non-existent) 'verified by Visa' account, the order still \r\n\r\nwent through without a problem. If I were, in fact, some nefarious ne&#039;er-do-well who had \r\n\r\nstolen some poor dude&#039;s debit (not credit) card so that I could buy keyboards on the internet, \r\n\r\nI would have easily accomplished that goal, and I wouldn&#039;t even have needed to verify <em>My \r\n\r\nOwn Name</em> to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa and Chase Bank, you obviously are trying to ensure my safety online. I understand \r\n\r\nthat. I appreciate your efforts, but I also laugh at them. You are, frankly, doing a terrible \r\n\r\njob. I suspect that this is part of a larger conspiracy to convince people to continue to shop \r\n\r\nin real stores instead of buying goods online, and that idea scares me. I feel more secure \r\n\r\nwith my Facebook account than I do with my debit card. This is simply a travesty, and it is so \r\n\r\nmuch a travesty that I felt the necessity to write this open letter to you immediately. Put \r\n\r\nsimply, you are ruining the world. Please make an effort to allow me to control where my own \r\n\r\nmoney goes, and don&#039;t punish me for trying to do so. I assure you, I know what I&#039;m doing, and \r\n\r\nif I can&#039;t figure it out, someone who isn&#039;t between the ages of 18 and 25 will never have a \r\n\r\nchance. After this, I completely understand how our economy has gotten to where it is. Visa \r\n\r\nand Chase Bank, you are to blame. I wish I didn&#039;t despise the way our society works just a \r\n\r\nlittle bit more each and every time I make a purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just wanted a goddamn keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shauvon G.

I feel deeply, truly sorry for my boss, John Powers, because I&#039;m sure this is an extremely stressful and difficult situation for him. I hope that your thoughts, and your prayers (if you are so inclined) will go out to him and his wife in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This also, as you have probably assumed, puts me out of a job. I am trying to see this as an opportunity, not a curse. I will have some time to finish my latest project, a screenplay about a new college graduate who is looking for a job in Chicago (it&#039;s a creative stretch, I know). I am hoping that I can find a new job in the next two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have often wondered what I would do if I lost my job. I think it&#039;s an interesting thing to think about sometimes, like what you would do if you were mugged, or how you would survive a zombie invasion, or what you would say if you were the guest on an episode of <em>Top Gear</em>. I know how much money I need to have each month to survive, so I can estimate how long I can last without an income before I am completely 'brokd.' I feel I can last a little while under my current situation (although my current situation is not without turmoil, which I will be sure to explain when it all blows over). This will, at the very least, help me understand what it is to be an adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long could you last if you lost your job? How much money would you have to save to extend that? These are questions you might want to consider, in case you end up in a situation similar to mine. I will be sure to keep you all updated on my progress, and let you know what the job scene is like in the big 'shy-town.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mean time, if anybody out there knows of any freelance web design, photography, music production, graphic design, programming, videography, video post-production, or writing jobs out there, let me know.

      "title": "New Decade",
      "text": "<p>People are throwing around the idea that 2010 is an entirely new decade. This is justifiable. The number 10 has an extra digit, which means it&#039;s not the same as 9. However, another (smaller) group of people claim that 2010 is not the first year of a new decade, but actually the last year of the last (current) one. They claim that there was no 'Year Zero' so the decade starts with one instead of zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those people are wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a time I agreed that 10 is the last number of the 'ones,' and not the first number of the 'teens.' This is true, because you don&#039;t start counting with zero. However, time doesn&#039;t work that way. There was, in fact, a year zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the following example: when you were born, how old were you? You were not one, you were zero. You had completed zero years of life. On your first birthday, you turn one, which means that you have completed one year of life. However, you are not in the first year of your life, are you? You are in the second year of your life. When you turn ten, you are not entering your tenth year, you are entering your eleventh. When you turn ten, you&#039;ve entered the second decade of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the debate becomes not what year this is, but when we started counting. Did year one start at the beginning of time, or at the end of the first year of the modern calendar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theoretically, the calendar is based on the birth of Jesus Christ (who&#039;s birthday was about a week ago). If that is the case, year one should coincide with Jesus&#039; first birthday, which marks not the beginning of the first year, but the end of the first year. That would make this the end of the 2010th year, and the beginning of the 2011th, or the beginning of the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One major problem is that the people who invented the modern 12-month, 365-day (give or take) calendar, were morons. They didn&#039;t understand the concept of zero, so the first year of the calendar is 1, and the year before that was 1 B.C (or negative-one).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We currently use the Gregorian Calendar, which was an improvement of the Julian Calendar, which was just thought up by some dudes who were bored because nobody had invented video games yet. The problem is that these calendars mainly just describe what a year is, when leap-years are, how many months there are, and other things important to your bank and electric company. However, they kind of gloss over when it all starts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&#039;t just go from Year Negative-One to Year One. That&#039;s stupid. If the negative years are in fact 'Before Christ' there would have to be a year that was Zero Years Before Christ. From the day before He was born to 365 days before He was born, no years had passed. Those 365 days were 0 B.C. Nobody stopped to think about that, though, because in the 1500&#039;s when the Gregorian Calendar was thought up, they were too busy going on Crusades, dying of the Plague, and other things that killed off anybody who questioned the Pope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astronomers, on the other hand, do recognize a year zero. In case you were wondering, astronomers are scientists who spend their entire lives studying the motions and natures of the entire goddamn universe. I&#039;m somewhat inclined to believe scientists over old dudes who sit around all day telling ghost stories. We don&#039;t need to get into a theological debate, however, because that&#039;s neither here nor there. Years have to start somewhere, so why not make it an arbitrary dude&#039;s birth way back a long time ago?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s where it gets muddy. You see, it&#039;s not really based on <em>anything</em>, when you get down to it. Yes, this is 2010, which is two-thousand ten years from <em>something</em>, presumably something that happened two-thousand ten years ago. But the thing is that that <em>something</em> was two-thousand ten years from <em>something</em> else, which was also probably pretty interesting, involving cavemen riding dinosaurs and Brad Pitt beating the crap out of Eric Bana or something. It&#039;s all arbitrary and ultimately completely meaningless. The current year certainly hasn&#039;t measured the entire course of human history, which I think would be a much better scale. What if we could say that it was exactly 12,010 years since Grugg first picked up a big piece of wood, bashed it against Brugg, and then stole his wife, thereby setting a benchmark for all Human Progress from then on? That would be much cooler. Imagine how much we&#039;ve done since that fateful day in Mr. and Mrs. Brugg&#039;s cave? It means as much as anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s only 2010 because that&#039;s what we call it. It&#039;s only 1459 in the Armenian calendar. It&#039;s 2960 in the Berber calendar, which sounds <strong>way</strong> cooler than boring ol&#039; Twenty-Ten. The Byzantine calendar puts us in years 7518 and 7519. These are all just numbers. Random numbers that groups of people have been counting ever since the point that they . . . started counting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is that this <strong>is</strong> the start of a new decade, because it <strong>has</strong> been ten years from <em>something.</em> Who cares if it&#039;s one or zero, or two-thousand ten, or seven thousand five hundred eighteen? We have so few opportunities to celebrate something that marks our progress and achievement as a species that doesn&#039;t involve having murdered someone or coming up with a great new way to sell advertising space. Let&#039;s just take this one, because it is a big deal. It&#039;s a chance to move on from the (myriad) mistakes of the last ten years, and start with a proverbial 'clean slate.' We need that every once in a while. In fact, if you celebrated the new Millennium in 2000 (like a normal person), then it <strong>has</strong> been exactly ten years, so for you it <strong>is</strong> a whole new decade, no matter what anybody says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And another thing: people who talk about how this isn&#039;t a new decade and who still argue that the new Millennium started in 2001 are a bunch of dwonks. They&#039;re mostly the same people who use 'win' as a noun (the wrong way) and think cats with zany captions are the greatest thing they&#039;ve seen since their mom reupholstered their basement/bedroom. Don&#039;t listen to them. They just want you to join their World of Warcraft guild or trade some Pokeman cards with them or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So wear your head high, noble human. You&#039;re living in a whole new year, a whole new decade, and a whole new life! You have nothing but opportunities ahead of you, a brand new pair of socks or whatever type of clothing your parents got you for Christmas. You may have made some mistakes in the last decade, started a few wars, messed up your economy (which for that matter is also just a bunch of numbers you made up), and gave way too much attention to Paris Hilton, but none of that matters now! You&#039;re a new man (or hu-man), a fresh canvas. Sure, you&#039;ve got that weird rash and a cirrhotic liver, but who cares! Life is your oyster!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celebrate the new decade with pride, noble human, and next time someone tries to tell you you&#039;re wrong, just remind them that we&#039;re not in 2010 at all, we&#039;re actually somewhere between 1,262,304,000 and 1,293,839,999 (the Unix time codes spanning the next 365 days). After all, that&#039;s the only time that will really matter when the machines take over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and that&#039;s not even getting into all that Mayan calendar malarky that my Mom has repeatedly gone on long rants about. Talk about complicated . . .</p>",

      "text": "<p>I don&#039;t make many posts on here about computer stuff, and I feel like I should have more. I&#039;ve spent a great deal of time thinking about computers, I have tons of experience working on computers, and I have two computers of my very own. I think I probably have a lot to say that would at the least give you something to think or talk about, and might even improve your life.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Well, this is a post about computer stuff.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I use Windows on my computers, for numerous reasons which would be the subject of an entirely different post (or several). Although Windows became more secure all the time as we went through the last decade, and I have always been a very safe and responsible computer user, it is still a good idea to use additional security on my system. Apple Computer Company wants you to think that by just turning on a Windows computer without an antivirus program you will soon die of H1N1. This is not remotely true. Especially with Windows 7 (possibly the greatest computer operating system ever made), you can safely connect your computer to the internet (through a firewall-equipped router, of course) without an antivirus and you will be fine. Just don&#039;t be a knucklehead about it. Don&#039;t go to shady websites, do use Firefox with Adblock Plus, don&#039;t install anything (<em>anything</em>) unless it&#039;s from a trusted source and you know exactly what it is, and do be careful with spam emails. Do these things, and you can live virus and spyware free (most likely, anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you get that handy registry-fixer program you found on download.com? No. How about Super PC Cleaner 2.0? Absolutely not! If you&#039;re not sure what it is, don&#039;t install it. Really, if you&#039;re not a 'power user' and it isn&#039;t the Firefox installer (downloaded directly from Mozilla.com), don&#039;t download it. You don&#039;t need special utilities to keep Windows running properly, especially if you have Vista or 7. You don&#039;t need that zany screensaver. You don&#039;t need that goofy theme that makes the mouse cursor into a little dancing penguin. Just don&#039;t do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you do need is an antivirus program. Ok, so you don&#039;t really need one, sure, but if you&#039;re not a genius like me, it&#039;s probably a good idea. The problem is that companies like Symantec and McAfee want you to pay them tons of money (rather frequently, if they have their way) to use their products. You shouldn&#039;t have to spend tons of money for something you shouldn&#039;t ever need. Luckily, you don&#039;t have to, because free options are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve used free antiviruses off and on for years. Purdue offered a free version of McAfee to Purdue students, and I used it some. McAfee sucks, though. You could try a program called AVG Antivirus, which is offered in a stripped-down free version. It works ok, but it gets rather obnoxious about telling you that you can give them money for a copy of the program you&#039;re already using. Another option is Avast! Antivirus, which wins the prize for most exciting name for what is ultimately an extremely boring product. I&#039;ve noticed that Avast! uses an unnecessary amount of system resources and frankly does too much. For spyware protection, you have programs like AdAware, which only runs when you ask it to. Having a scanner like that 'on call' is good and bad, but it still isn&#039;t really an antivirus so whatever. There just isn&#039;t a good solution, anymore. I began to think that perhaps the ship had sailed, and just like the dream of being able to say things on Twitter and Facebook without my parents seeing it, the dream of a free antivirus was dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I found the solution, and - here&#039;s the kicker - it was made by Microsoft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome back. I hope you didn&#039;t hit your head when you passed out. Yes, I know it&#039;s crazy news to hear that not only has Microsoft (a multi-billion dollar corporation) made an operating system that works fine without having to install any free utilities advertised by banner ads on your favorite porn websites, but they have also created a pretty good antivirus for it. You see, Microsoft is not the same Microsoft that we all loved to hate last decade. They actually asked people how Windows 7 was before they released it, and now they&#039;re actually protecting it from all those viruses Apple wants you to think are out there. That&#039;s what a company does that actually cares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s called Microsoft Security Essentials, and it&#039;s available for XP, Vista, and 7, in both 32 and 64 bit versions. You can download it on <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/'>this page</a>. Before you install it, you should (this is important) shut down and remove all antiviri and anti-spyware programs currently installed on your computer (including stuff like Adaware). Then you can install MSE, and be prepared to let it download an update and run a scan as soon as it&#039;s done installing. The whole process is pretty quick, as antivirussies go. Like other antivirals, it will run in the background, but unlike most antivirucities, it doesn&#039;t take up a lot of your precious RAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with Antiviroose is that while they&#039;re running, they take up so many resources they cause problems for everything else you&#039;re trying to do. You&#039;re supposed to turn them off when you install anything, they can cause problems in games and other intensive applications, and there are tons of compatibility issues with other programs. The cure is as bad as the disease. With MSE, however, you don&#039;t really have to worry about it as much. It&#039;s light, so it won&#039;t slow your computer down. I haven&#039;t noticed any problems with other applications, and it&#039;s getting good marks online. It&#039;s still pretty new, so compatibility issues and other problems could crop up, so don&#039;t expect it to be perfect right away. Since it&#039;s made by Microsoft, it should run pretty nicely with Windows, though. All in all, it&#039;s a great piece of kit, and the best part is that it&#039;s free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I don&#039;t know if I would recommend that you dump your current antivirus at your business and dive right in to MSE. It&#039;s still new, so you never know what problems might crop up. It might not quite be ready for full-scale deployment to systems that are important for your small business. It&#039;s no problem for your home computer, though, so I do recommend that you get it running as soon as possible. On the web page linked above is a link to the new Forefront Client Security, which is some kind of antivirus solution for business computers. It&#039;s essentially the same thing as MSE, but it can be run and managed on networked computers from a central location, like a server, which makes it great for businesses. It seems to still be in Beta, though, which means it&#039;s not necessarily finished yet. Consider it 'use at your own risk.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real question here is why they didn&#039;t include Security Essentials as part of Windows 7 in the first place. Maybe they did; I&#039;m still using the Release Candidate because I&#039;m too lazy to install the actual product (I do have it, though). If that&#039;s the case, then it&#039;s super awesome. However, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case, and I have a theory as to why. It probably wasn&#039;t ready to be deployed yet, so they didn&#039;t want to include an unfinished antivirus in Windows 7. More importantly, however, I don&#039;t think it would be taken seriously if it were. Most of the point of an antivirus, frankly, is to make you less afraid of all of the viruses Apple keeps telling you about. Since people seem to be very weary of utilities included in Windows, it could be that nobody would trust an antivirus that they didn&#039;t install themselves. People need to go through the process of installing an antivirus, to feel like they&#039;re really doing something about that damn techno-flu. That&#039;s why, I think, Microsoft won&#039;t just include an antivirus as part of Windows for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, computers need placebos, too.</p>",

      "text": "<p>I&#039;ve been unemployed now for a couple months, and I&#039;m starting to get bored. I figured I would take some time talk about <em>Avatar</em>, the big blockbuster from James Cameron. If you haven&#039;t heard about this film, then you probably have much more important things to worry about, like whatever creatures are trying to also live in your cave with you, or when the Child Fund is going to give you today&#039;s cup of coffee so you can go to school or whatever. If you don&#039;t live in a cave or in some third world country, then you&#039;ve probably heard a lot about this film, and maybe even more about how bad it might be. Allow me to give a counter point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, asking you to care what I think is as wrong as blindly agreeing with what everybody else has to say. You should still read my argument, though, because I think it&#039;s important in this world.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Read my thoughts.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Avatar</em> followed the regular lifestyle of a major, supposedly game changing, blockbuster film. It took much longer to make than a normal film, had an army of designers large enough to invade Poland, and cost more money than God. The hype was insurmountable in the weeks before it came out, it made more money than any other movie that came out in the same year (even though it came out only a few weeks before the year ended), and then after about a week everybody started talking about how bad it was. This is the standard path of a major motion picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here we are, long enough after the movie&#039;s release that everybody&#039;s either seen it or doesn&#039;t want to (or lives for less than a cup of coffee a day). People are starting to talk about how bad it was, saying it was just like <a href='http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/130283/original.jpg'>Pocahontas</a> or whatever. The plot was cliche, the characters flat and predictable, or the special effects were mediocre. The hyper-critical public internet opinion machine has said its piece, and that&#039;s all anybody needs to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps it&#039;s just because I&#039;m insane (or my 'Deny Conformity' nature), but the more I hear people talk about how bad it was, the more I want to like it. Before I saw it I was fully prepared to be incredibly annoyed by <em>Avatar</em> when I went to see it. I wasn&#039;t even that interested in seeing it. It seemed to me like a totally cliche and predictable futuristic <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. Still, when you hear things like 'changes film forever' you kind of have to see what they mean. So I saw it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was wrong, and so are you, if you say it was bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point in the film, I realized why I was annoyed by it. It occurred to me that <em>Avatar</em> isn&#039;t a film at all. It&#039;s a masterpiece. I&#039;m not saying that like, 'it wasn&#039;t good . . . it was great!' I just mean that it was a feat beyond a normal film. It was an achievement that we&#039;ve never seen before, and will never see again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron first wrote a treatment for <em>Avatar</em> in 1994. That was fifteen years ago. He originally thought up the basic elements of what became <em>Avatar</em>&#039;s alien race in a film he wrote in 1976, over thirty years ago. He pretty much made Titanic so he could work on this movie. He invented technology to make movies in 3d for this movie. He waited for fifteen years for technology to be able to do what he wanted it to do. Did you notice how he never really did anything since Titanic came out in 1997? That&#039;s because he was working on <em>this goddamn movie</em>. I think that much devotion and determination from the highest grossing director ever deserves at least a little respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want you to put the plot and the characters and even the special effects aside for a moment. Think about what was done for <em>Avatar</em>. They invented an entire language just for this movie. That&#039;s never been done before. They developed an entire culture and society based around an entire made-up planet full of thousands of made-up species of plant and animal life. This isn&#039;t just regular sci-fi design where some artists sit around and say, 'hey, this looks cool.' A team of designers and actual, factual scientists discussed the biology of the entire planet. They designed things based on how animals would have evolved there. They spent years developing not just some cool looking creatures, but the entire ecosystem that supports them. The virtual designs and assets for Pandora filled over a petabyte of storage.  That&#039;s one million gigabytes! All that is <em>on top</em> of the usual futuristic human spaceships, weapons, and other technology that you&#039;d find in a sci-fi movie. They invented an entire goddamn planet from scratch, and you&#039;re complaining that the characters are a little flat?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, how about the technical achievements in <em>Avatar</em>? You know how a bunch of movies have been coming out in 3D lately? That&#039;s pretty much James Cameron&#039;s doing. He made the first modern polarized 3D film in 2003, and he didn&#039;t do it just to play around with new technology. He did it for <em>Avatar</em>. He let it soak in, and waited for the novelty to wear off, so we were used to it and comfortable with it before he made his opus. He waited for us to get over that whole 'hey look it&#039;s 3D' bullshit where stuff flies right at the screen just to freak people out. You&#039;ll find none of that in <em>Avatar</em>. Like everything else, 3D is just part of the world, not a gimmick. It is part of the world, too. I thought it was a little weird that the photographs on a wall at one point were in 3D with everything else, until I realized that it&#039;s the future, and they simply have 3D photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also invented a new way to do motion capture for this thing. I&#039;ve dabbled in animation enough to know that the animation for the completely computer generated alien creatures was phenomenal. Cameron strapped cameras to the actors&#039; faces so that the animators could capture every single nuance in the actors&#039; expressions. Really, the amount of work that went into just the animation on every single frame of this movie is staggering. It challenges everything ever animated before, honestly.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/avatar/transformers_vs_avatar_small.jpg' style='float: right; margin-left: 10px' />\r\n\r\n<p>Just look at the number of people involved with this movie. Pictured to the right is a comparison of the 'visual effects by' lists on IMDB of <em>Transformers</em> (on the left) and <em>Avatar</em> (on the right). <em>Transformers</em> was no slouch when it came to visual effects, and it certainly busted a few blocks back in its day, but just look at the difference. The number of people under 'visual effects by' on IMDB for <em>Avatar</em> is almost <em>three times</em> the number of people listed for <em>Transformers</em>. That&#039;s ridiculous.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Just think about this: for the first time (and maybe only time) ever, both Weta Digital (<em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>District 9</em>) and ILM (<em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>) worked on the same film. That&#039;s how complicated <em>Avatar</em> was to make. The two largest special effects houses on the planet were <em>both</em> required to pull it off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of this movie, predictably, was shot on a sound stage entirely painted green. As most people know, special effects shots are done in front of a green screen, because they can easily cut out the green background and replace it with whatever they want to replace it with. Normally this means that while shooting the movie everybody just has to imagine what&#039;s going on around them, since all they can actually see is green walls and some camera equipment. That was not the case with Avatar. Cameron had a system where he could actually see everything he wanted to see in the shot, as they were shooting it, like a giant (planet sized) video game level. He could move around in the world as easily as he could walk around a real set, and do whatever he wanted with shots on the fly. That&#039;s a big deal, especially for actors who are sick of pretending that giant green cylinders are some kind of monster thing so much that they&#039;re developing an irrational hatred for the color. Of anything developed for <em>Avatar</em>, this is most likely to change the way movies are made from now on, and it&#039;s the kind of innovation that most of the base plebeians on the internet (the kind who say that this is still last decade) will never know or care about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just think about how much work went into <em>Avatar</em>, especially compared to other films. A regular film, especially one with a lot of special effects, is a monumental undertaking. I&#039;ve made movies that are only seven minutes long and they&#039;ve almost killed me. The work required for a feature-length film is insane, for hundreds, if not thousands, of people. <em>Avatar</em> was at least three times that much effort, and took at least ten times as long. You&#039;re willing to just shrug that off because the plot was a little cliche?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But yes, how about that plot, then? Yes, you&#039;re all right, it does seem to draw heavily on Disney&#039;s <em>Pocahontas</em>. The thing is, do you know what other movie drew heavily from the story of Pocahontas? Disney&#039;s goddamn <em>Pocahontas</em>. It&#039;s not like they wrote the story. It&#039;s a classic tale from American mythology. Plenty of movies take inspiration from mythology, and they&#039;re lauded. <em>Avatar</em> does it and it&#039;s a rip off? That&#039;s not fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discrediting a film because its plot is cliche is like discrediting Picasso for using paint brushes. There are only so many ways you can tell a story. That&#039;s just the truth. You can go buy one of a hundred books listing the thirty six dramatic situations you can use in a story. You probably shouldn&#039;t, though, because you&#039;re going to see a lot of stuff that&#039;s been done in movies before. After the ten billion or so movies people have made, it&#039;s very hard to make one that doesn&#039;t have something somebody else already thought of. So why not embrace that? Cameron, I think, <em>uses</em> cliche. He uses it like an artists uses any of his tools. Why waste time going out of your way to explain something when you can just make it something we&#039;re already familiar with, and move on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Face it, you didn&#039;t go to see that movie expecting goddamn Shakespeare. You weren&#039;t hoping for a brilliant plot or the most amazing character development you&#039;ve ever seen. You went there wanting to watch some giant blue aliens fight big ass robots in 3D, and that&#039;s the truth. Cameron wanted to show us this world he created. He wasn&#039;t trying to create some sort of high literature. He just wanted to show us some giant blue aliens fighting big ass robots. Why do you expect more than that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does anybody hate on <em>Terminator</em> because the Terminator&#039;s character isn&#039;t developed that well? No, <em>Terminator</em> was awesome because it was about a sweet killer robot, and that&#039;s what it delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look past the cliche and simplicity of the central plot (you could even call it 'elegant simplicity'), you might actually see some interesting themes. Cameron does a lot of exploration of duality, and I think the idea of someone needing an 'avatar' to find their place in a world is none too relevant in this increasingly internet-centered society. He delivers an poignant message about humanity&#039;s increasingly destructive path on its obsession for 'unobtanium,' a blatant symbol for our out-of-control desire for things that we can&#039;t have, and that part of us that can never be satisfied. Having that simple, basic concept of 'unobtanium' is a perfect example. It&#039;s perhaps cliche and unrealistic, but you immediately understand the point. It&#039;s the perfect, irresistible prize that&#039;s just on the other side of the line between good and evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plot of <em>Avatar</em> is hardly the point at all. In a way, the done-before and cliche nature of the plot is in itself an example of one of the film&#039;s most important themes, the dangers of insatiable desire, and finding peace in simplicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I truly believe that it is inconsequential whether or not the movie is good. <em>Avatar</em>&#039;s quality is irrelevant. What matters is that <em>Avatar</em> stands as a monument of what a human being is capable of. It is the ultimate work of James Cameron&#039;s life, and it is his opus. <em>Avatar</em> is Beethoven&#039;s 9th symphony. It is Michelangelo&#039;s David. It is Cameron&#039;s masterpiece, and that just doesn&#039;t happen anymore. In a world where all we care about is how much money we can make (the ultimate unobtanium), it seems like nobody cares anymore about what we can actually <em>do</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That&#039;s why you should watch <em>Avatar</em>, and why it deserves your respect.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all major, supposedly game changing, blockbuster films, <em>Avatar</em> will eventually find its place in the annals of history. Eventually I think people will, at least subconscious, think of it as a benchmark for all films to come. I think <em>Avatar</em> might even get the consideration it deserves, long from now, when seen with the calm, malevolent eyes of hindsight. I wonder if anybody said that the Mona Lisa was a little simple and boring when it was first made.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, all of the subtitles (and the movie posters) are in Papyrus, the second worst font on the planet. So yeah, screw that movie.</p>",

      "title": "My Colossal Job",
      "text": "<p>I got a job last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s pretty cool, too. I&#039;m working for a medium-sized web design company called Colossal Squid. Its a really dynamic and hard-working team, and I&#039;m both excited and terrified (good terrified) to be working there. This is the first time I&#039;ve worked with a team of dudes who are really awesome and who know exactly what I do and what they need me for. My last few positions have been more general, less hardcore, and I am nervous about the fact that this team is going to want my absolute best. I think I might just be up for the task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today was my first day. Of course, I didn&#039;t have much actual work to do today, and what they gave me to do was pretty basic. Today I had to create an e-mail newsletter from a Photoshop mock-up. If you know anything about web design, you probably know that e-mail clients can&#039;t really support any major styling, so you have to make them with a bunch of images and tables (as opposed to using more modern CSS with background images). If you know anything about web design, you know that making entire web pages with HTML tables is a terrible thing for all parties. However, it is what must be done, and if this is what they need me to do, I will do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my first real job, if you want to get down to it. My actual first full time job out of college was working from home, so that doesn&#039;t really count. After working from home for about six months, and then being unemployed for another three, I&#039;m not used to a normal job. For Colossal Squid, I will actually have to put on pants, take a bus to an office building (in the west loop), sit at a desk for nine hours a day, and interact with real human beings. I hope I haven&#039;t forgotten how to do all of those things. I am most worried about my roommate&#039;s cat, Alice. Without me around all day, she will have nobody to beg for her dinner for the hour or so before Sarah gets home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strangely, the idea of spending most of my days at work is very liberating. When I had all of my time to myself, I felt so useless if I didn&#039;t spend every single moment working on a screenplay, or this website, or writing something, or doing photography, or working on music, or looking for a job, or whatever. Now that I have something I have to do all the time, it&#039;s no longer my fault that I don&#039;t get all these crazy schemes done. I might keep some of these ideas on the backburner, though. I mean, a pizza place that specializes in double-decker pizzas? How can that fail?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A half-hour commute means an extra hour every day that I have to just sit quietly and do nothing. I will have to think of interesting ways to occupy myself (like how I&#039;m doing right now, because I&#039;m writing this on my way home from work). Maybe I will take up knitting, or I will practice being a DJ on the bus, or take up live-blogging, or solicit, or buy a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting a job is like getting a girlfriend. For a while, you spend a few months sitting on the couch in your underwear, eating ice cream and watching reruns of old TV shows, thinking that you&#039;re totally useless and you&#039;ll never find another one like the one you just lost. Then you slowly get over yourself, and you start to go out a little, talking to some people and getting your name out there. You give out your resume (or your phone number) to hundreds of people, and you may even hear back from one or two. You can always try to go online, which could theoretically save you a lot of time and effort, but you&#039;ll mainly only hear from weirdos and creeps who want you to do some kind of porn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you find somebody you really like, the courtship begins. You&#039;ll meet up, maybe for lunch or drinks, and get to know each other a little bit. You put on your best tie and present yourself as best you can (even throwing out some smart-sounding buzz words from your field or profession), so that they think you&#039;re totally classy and intelligent all the time. If you&#039;re really lucky, they&#039;ll ask to see you again. Maybe they will show you some of their friends, so you&#039;ll see the people you&#039;ll have to hang out with if it all goes well. Of course, if it does go well, you can count on losing most of your free time because they&#039;re going to want you around pretty much all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s a bit of a learning curve, as you figure out just how they like to do things. They might make it seem like you&#039;re free to do your own thing, but you just keep your head down and do what they tell you. Let&#039;s face it, you&#039;re really only in it for that big event every couple weeks (you know, the paycheck).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would keep this whole analogy going, but frankly I haven&#039;t really gotten that serious with a girl or a job, so I would only be making stuff up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s going to take some time to get used to the whole 'being employed' thing, but hopefully it will be as easy as what I&#039;ve been used to, which is 'being a loser.'</p>",

My expenses stayed the same as the semester ended, but I suddenly had much more time to work, resulting in my income going up substantially. The sudden influx of cash always left as quickly as it came, as I used it not to invest or save (as a reasonable person would do) but to fuel one of my favorite hobbies, rebuilding my computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The months of April and May usually see me exploring the virtual aisles of Newegg.com, which most people would recognize as the best place for people who consider pictures of motherboards almost like pornography. Again and again I would check various components, judging which would be the best option for my new super-machine. Each year the shiny new bits would come usually on the same day, and usually in one big, glorious box. My former roommate John and I would come to call these events 'Mini-Christmas.' My credit card company would come to call them 'flag for potential identity theft.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would seem that this year the trend continues, as I find myself pouring over Newegg shopping carts once again. This year is different, though. My computer bits just aren&#039;t old enough yet to justify dropping a bunch of cash to upgrade. This year I&#039;m building something that will actually be useful and might actually improve my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, I&#039;m building a web server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have simply had it with my current host (<a href='http://www.startlogic.com'>Startlogic</a>) and their continual outages, bouts of slowness, and their inexplicable need to constantly change my ftp address. The time has come to throw off the shackles of my web host and take my tiny little media empire into my own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This certainly won&#039;t be easy, mind you. I&#039;ll have to negotiate with my ISP, RCN (this series is going to have a lot of acronyms) about the increased throughput on my connection, and about giving me my own static IP address. I will need to get Linux up and running on the new machine, complete with Apache, numerous MySQL databases and an email server. I will need to reconfigure <a href='http://www.tehcrazymonkeys.com'>my</a> <a href='http://www.myNameIsSmac.com'>various</a> <a href='http://www.improvdatabase.com'>domains</a> to point to the new server. On top of all of this, I need to finally finish that sweet <a href='/future'>new design</a> for DenyConformity.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will I succeed? Will my obsession with using Gentoo Linux melt my waxen wings? Will RCN even allow me to run a web server from home without charging me ridiculous amounts of money? Will a home-built, entry-level PC suffice for the virtually ones of hits I receive every day? What other unforseen difficulties will pop up, threatening to ruin the entire project? Will I ever get around to doing it, or am I just going to keep talking about it all the time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answers to these (and more) questions will come in the next few months. Stay tuned for the continuing adventures of . . . </p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images//webserver_logo.jpg' alt='The DenyConformity.com webserver' style='width: 400; display: block; margin: auto' />\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

      "text": "\n\n<p>I&#039;ve been working a lot, and <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> has burned through what little free time I&#039;ve had, so I haven&#039;t had much time to make any progress on this summer&#039;s project,</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images//webserver_logo.jpg' alt='The DenyConformity.com Webserver' style='display: block; margin: auto' height='270' width='433'><p>So, <strong>step 1</strong> of the process is to get things cleared with my internet provider, <strong>RCN</strong>. As far as I know, RCN stands for Really . . . Crappy . . . well, yeah I have no idea what RCN stands for. I do know that they have pretty poor customer service, though. I&#039;m currently installing Microsoft Visual Studio for a project at work which is on a .NET environment, so I had a few hours to kill. I decided to give RCN a ring. After navigating a maze of 'push X for X' options, I finally got a human (supposedly) voice. She, of course, had no idea what a web server was, so I decided to make things easier and just ask for a static IP address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so here&#039;s your <strong>first lesson</strong> about the <strong>internets</strong>. As we all know, the internet is supposedly this vast series of tubes connecting billions of perverts with each other around the world. Actually, though, the internet is more like a vast card catalog, arranged not by some sort of Dewey Decimal or category, but by address. Since the internet operates on a specific protocol (called the Internet Protocol), every single computer (or computer network) has its own unique IP address. Yes, you, right now, looking at this website, have an IP address, even if you&#039;re connected via Cellphone Telephone, Dial-up (hi Mom), or the world&#039;s fastest fiber optic connection. That IP address is sort of like your computer&#039;s phone number, or to put it in a much more literal way, your computer&#039;s address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites are just cards in this giant card catalog, and all you have to do to access them is call up that IP address. Websites are stored on computers all over the world (even giant mega-servers are just computers), and those computers (or Web Servers) have a specific IP address that applies only to them. So, to access a web server and load the website contained within, all you have to do is navigate to that server&#039;s IP address over the HyperText Transfer Protocol (that&#039;s what that little HTTP:// means). We don&#039;t need to get into specifics about what the HTTP actually is, but basically it just tells your computer how to communicate properly with the IP address it is accessing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s an example (just a little sample). Google is a pretty popular website. If you don&#039;t know what Google is, then I urge you to spend a little more time acclimating yourself with our time period before you dive into the ins and outs of the internet. Also, I would like to borrow your time machine. Anyway, Google runs on a computer, just like the computer you&#039;re staring at right now. Sure, Google&#039;s servers have storage and computational ability lightyears beyond the computer you&#039;re looking at (probably), but in essence they are the same. Primarily, Google&#039;s server connects to the same internet you&#039;re connected to, and they have an IP address just like you. Google&#039;s IP address is 209.85.135.104. Just four simple numbers. Instead of typing 'www.google.com' into your browser&#039;s address bar, you can type 'http://209.85.135.104/' and you&#039;ll get the exact same thing. Kind of neat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why don&#039;t we see more IP addresses in our daily, internet drenched lives? It is because of another nifty little acronym, DNS. DNS stands for 'Domain Name System' and it is a universal system for providing shortcuts to the cards in that giant card catalog. Just check out the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System'>Wikipedia page for DNS</a> if you&#039;re really interested. Basically, when you type in a domain name (google.com, for instance), your computer accesses a special server called a Name Server, which tells your computer what IP address is associated with that domain name. Your browser then figures out the IP address and usually a subdirectory (sometimes a single server can host multiple websites, so one IP address will have several domains associated with it) and then it calls up that address. All that happens before your computer even accesses the server (the process of client-server communication is also fascinating, but totally another story). It&#039;s certainly quite complicated, but if you can think of a better way to have a distributed network of completely independent machines all communicating with each other in a vast worldwide network, you&#039;re certainly wasting your time here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so computers have IP addresses, but the problem with internet service providers like RCN is that they are constantly randomizing those addresses. Your home network will be assigned a new IP every once in a while, through a process called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). There are many reasons for this, mainly that it would be a pain in the ass to manually assign an IP address to hundreds of thousands of internet customers. What does this mean for someone wanting to build a web server at home? Well, if your IP address changes all the time, then where do you point the domain name?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s go back to that card catalog metaphor. Say you&#039;re looking for a book, perhaps a copy of <em>Montgumery Rood</em>, by A Chicken (yes, I&#039;m referencing my own <a href='http://denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00248'>podcast</a>). Well, it&#039;s easy, right? You just open up the 'A' drawer in the card catalog . . . </p>\r\n\r\n<p>They don&#039;t even use card catalogs anymore, do they? That&#039;s a stupid metaphor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, say you&#039;re doing a crossword puzzle. Yeah, this is good. You&#039;re doing a crossword puzzle, and you look at the clue for 23 across. It says 'Invented the apple, colleague of Borrison' (yes, another <a href='http://denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00245'>podcast</a> reference). Well, obviously the answer is 'Smith,' so you look up at the puzzle for the horizontal row of boxes marked with a little '23.' Simple, now you know that 'Smith' goes in those little boxes. That&#039;s not entirely dissimilar to how the internets work. Typing in 'google.com' is like saying '23 across.' Your browser figures out what 23 across points to, and fills in the little boxes with the proper IP address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when a server is assigned addresses with DHCP, it&#039;s like that crossword puzzle is constantly shifting around. It would be impossible for you to solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images//dhcp_crossword.gif' height='326' width='326'><p>So what you need to do is get your internet provider to give you a static IP address, so that your little row of boxes never changes. You have to pay a little extra to your ISP, but you can always connect to your server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So okay, back to my phone call with RCN. As an ISP (Internet Service Provider), they know what a static IP address is, and it should be easy to get them to give me one. After I was transferred to the Internet Support division and we figured out which account we were dealing with (it&#039;s under my roommate Sarah&#039;s name), I told the person-on-the-phone what I needed and asked if it was possible and how much it would cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Okay, one moment, we will add a Static IP to this account.' She said, jumping to all sorts of conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Uh, well, how much will it be?' I responded, hoping to stop her from charging an account which doesn&#039;t even have my name on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'A Static IP is 19.95'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>' . . . per month?' (our internet plan is only $30 per month, so that seemed a little much to me)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Yes, 19.95 per month, plus a $25 set up fee.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Wait . . . ' I was about to try to get her to justify why typing four numbers into a router justified a $25 setup fee, but then I realized that was a stupid thing to argue. What was a far better thing to argue, I decided, was the fact that the <a href='http://www.rcn.com/chicago/high-speed-internet/extras/home-networking'>RCN website</a> advertises static IP services for only 9.95 / month.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images//Screen%20shot%202010-05-14%20at%2012.05.55%20PM.png' height='164' width='616'><div class='caption'>Unless I&#039;m seeing it wrong . . .</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We both took turns walking each other through the RCN website to find the price for Static IP, which I assured her said '9.95' which is not, in fact, '19.95.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'9.95,' I said, 'would be something I would be willing to pay. I would not be willing to pay 19.95.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'So you don&#039;t want to add Static IP to your account?' She asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'No, in fact, I never did want to add it to my account, I was just trying to figure out how much it will cost, and I wasn&#039;t really able to do that, so I guess I&#039;ll have to call again later.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to connect to my website via FTP (so I can upload files to it and stuff), and I am constantly receiving notifications that DenyConformity.com is down. So it would seem that the DenyConformity.com webserver has reach a bit of a predicament. I don&#039;t want to spend an additional $20 a month, but I can&#039;t stand sticking with <a href='http://www.startlogic.com'>Startlogic</a> any longer. Maybe I&#039;ll just bite the bullet and get the static IP address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.DynDNS.com'>Unless there&#039;s a better way.</a></p>\n\n",

      "text": "<p>I have been finding myself complaining about the world more and more lately. War. Famine. Oil spills. Everything is a mess. I&#039;ve decided to take it upon myself, as a person on the internet, to send my complaints to the person I think could to the most to fix it, the President of Earth. I don&#039;t know why nobody has thought of that before. There&#039;s no need to thank me, the benefit of having a better world is reward enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I guess if you want to send me gifts and stuff, you can.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Read the entire letter</p>\r\n\t\t\t<div style='text-align: left'>\r\n<p>Dear President of Earth,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How are you? I am just fine. I hope everything is going well for you there in your high chambers or whatever you call it. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard enough of this, but I would still like to congratulate you on your appointment to the highest position of respect and power in what is probably the greatest planet the Human Race has ever known (except, you know, wherever the pyramids came from). I&#039;m sure it&#039;s no small order to take the mantle of Leader of the Entire World, and you have a great deal of things to take care of. However, it&#039;s certainly a great achievement, and I hope you take a moment to step back and acknowledge what a thing you&#039;ve done there. I don&#039;t think I could get myself elected (or crowned, I&#039;m not sure how that works) President of an entire planet, even if I really tried hard for a few months. If your parents aren&#039;t proud of you by now, they probably never will be so you can stop trying to win their attention. I mean, just being able to introduce yourself as 'President of Earth' has to make up for all the hard work and stress you have to deal with. You probably live in Babeland, USA. Actually, you probably live in Dubai, because that&#039;s totally where I would go if I were president of Earth. Wherever you are, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re knee deep in all the hot chicks you can stand (or stand on, which I would probably do if I were President of Earth).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would love to do nothing but admire Your great, all-encompassing power and grace, Your Majesty (do I call You that?), but I do have some important issues to bring to Your attention instead. I realize that you probably have millions of things to think about at any given moment (many of them in Spanish, even), but I really think that the following issues are critical to the continued success of Human Beings as a unified species, and they are therefor of utmost importance to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first, and arguably most important complaint has to do with the fact that you don&#039;t exist. I&#039;m sure you can see what a hindrance this is to your ability to lead Earth into a time of continued prosperity. I can&#039;t tell you what a disappointment it is every time I wake up and realize that even though everybody in the world can talk to one another and pretty much everybody lives together in one society, we don&#039;t actually have any kind of unifying government to do anything to make the world a better place for everybody (and we all know the U.N. doesn&#039;t really count). I am tempted to include the word 'yet' when saying you don&#039;t exist, but, sadly, I am not sure if you will ever exist at all. Call me cynical, but considering how blas&#233; and, quite frankly, incompetent your administration has been so far, I would not be surprised if they continue to not exist for the foreseeable future. I think I speak for pretty much everybody when I say that this isn&#039;t really that great. I would ask, therefore, that you address this issue as soon as you possibly can. With power as seemingly limitless and mighty as yours, I&#039;m sure one could easily pull the necessary strings and jump through all of the proper 'hoops' to create oneself. I look forward to your first speech when you explain exactly how you pulled that off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second complaint came to me the other day when I was in the bath. It suddenly occurred to me that Humans, as awesome and mighty as we are, still only have the one planet. That is simply appalling to me. What is the point in living in the future if we cannot yet explore the cosmos and live among the stars? I understand that with all of the problems and pitfalls of running one planet you would be wary about taking on another, but you could easily appoint a governor or viceroy to watch over the new world. Hell, you could even name it after yourself! I would think that it would be a relief to you to know that out there is another world of humans that will continue the species even if you really screw things up here. I know that would take the edge off for me. Plus, it would be fun if we find a world inhabited by an equal or lesser species, because it would give us a chance to have a little War. You know how much we love War, and we don&#039;t get to do it that much anymore now that we&#039;re starting to realize how stupid it is to kill each other. If we found a nice, hostile planet, we could send everybody who wants to do War over there. That would sure make Earth seem nice and peaceful, wouldn&#039;t it? Who was the last world leader who could claim that he sent all War to an entirely different planet? Nobody, that&#039;s who.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are the limitless bounds of the cosmos a bit daunting for you? Don&#039;t worry, there are great works you can do for us here on home soil, too. You&#039;re probably already looking into this one, but I was at the movies the other day and I saw that movie about the iron man. There were two of them in the movie, and I thought it would be great if I had one of those, too. Then I could just fly to work and I could pick up cars and stuff. I know the movie wasn&#039;t real, but that&#039;s where you come in. You should tell somebody to make an iron man, and make sure that they make one big enough to fit a taller gentleman, like myself. In fact &ndash; this is another point entirely, actually &ndash; there&#039;s a lot you could do for tall people. For example, people never trim trees quite tall enough and I always end up bumping my head into branches and I get scratches on my face. Also the seats on planes are too small. Anyway, yeah, we should have iron mans. We could use them in our wars with other planets. When those stupid alien things see an army of flying metal dudes coming at them, they&#039;d totally poop their pants, if they could poop . . . or had pants. Shouldn&#039;t every human being be entitled to life, liberty, and the ability to be an Iron Man?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing: have you ever tried to park anywhere lately? Here in Chicago, they have these boxes where you pay to park, and you get a little sticker that you put in your window. While it works great, in theory, people don&#039;t know where the different parking spaces are, because each box applies to the whole block instead of each space separately. Now people just park wherever they feel like, leaving huge gaps in between each other, so all the spots run out of space, even for Smart Cars. It&#039;s a lot like communism, really. You&#039;re President of Earth; can&#039;t you do something about this? It would be better if you could do something rather soon, too, because I don&#039;t know how much longer this friend of mine can keep driving around the block looking for a space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, cars are pretty silly, if you get right down to it. I mean, we should just have tubes that go everywhere like in that show Futurama (there was even a President of Earth in Futurama, so you should be all over that). It would be just like at the bank. I think we should probably keep the 'no coins' rule, too, because I don&#039;t want to get hit in the butt with a quarter when I&#039;m trying to go somewhere. Anyway, my Mom is way more obsessed about Tube Technology, and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve probably gotten tons of letters from her already about that. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, that was another complaint. Can&#039;t you get the Internet for my Parents yet? They&#039;re still stuck with just dial up access, and you probably don&#039;t need me to tell you that dial up blows. Granted, they live in the middle of Nowhere, but Nowhere is still on Earth, isn&#039;t it? Last time I checked, you were President of There. Please tell somebody to get off their ass and run some wires out there or something. It&#039;s the future, for crying out loud. If we had iron mans, you could send out an iron man and he could just fly there with his rocket boots and a . . . bunch of . . . internets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, why does everybody in the world still use physical money? Can&#039;t we all just get some sort of credit card? Sure, it would be a shock to the system, and a few industries would be affected, but we (humans) are pretty smart, so we&#039;ll probably figure it out. I think that the removal of physical currency would probably most impact the vagrancy industry. It would be hard for bums on the street to ask for spare change if spare change only existed as fractions in someone&#039;s digital bank account. I can see how that could be a problem. If all those bums were unable to panhandle, there would be a lot of people out of out of work, and then they&#039;ll get kicked out of out of their homes. Still, they&#039;ll probably learn to adapt, I&#039;m sure. You could issue credit card readers to the various tech-savy tramps roaming the streets. The others could finally get what they really want anyway, and just ask for booze; either that or - you know - get a job. You could always issue iron man suits to all the bums in the world. That would at least be really interesting to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, these concerns seem daunting. I understand that. I mean, there you are, suddenly the most powerful human being on the planet, with a billion things to worry about (many of them in Spanish), and some random dude starts throwing his stupid problems at you? I mean, you&#039;re still struggling with the fact that you don&#039;t exist; how could you be expected to solve the lousy parking situation in Chicago, Illinois? I think, though, that as you look out of your two hundredth floor window at the developing Dubai skyline - a menagerie of cranes, bizarre structures and exposed girders - that the Human Race needs to pick itself up. We, as a species, need to get our Shit together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine, if you will, that you had a son (or if you have a son, picture a second son). Let&#039;s call him Gerald. Gerald just went off to college. He&#039;s living on his own, now, for the first time. You are happy for Gerald, and you know that he will do just fine. Gerald is a good kid; he&#039;s smart, full of vim (whatever that is), and ready to take on the world. However, you begin to receive complaints from Gerald&#039;s counselor or RA or whatever that he&#039;s starting to slip. Gerald is self-destructive, violent toward other students, greedy, irresponsible, ignoring his homework, and just a general asshole to the other students. Gerald has been trashing his dorm room and nobody can find his roommate, Passenger Pigeon (yeah, I went there). All Gerald does anymore is sit around drinking and playing video games. What would you do about that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You would tell Gerald to get his Shit together (or perhaps a variation on that theme). To any outside observer, Gerald is a menace to the world around him. He desperately needs to be contained. He desperately needs a parental figure to tell him to shape up, and to let him know what will happen if he doesn&#039;t (either the world explodes or Dean of Students Global Climate Change will come down and murder him). I&#039;m simply asking you, as Leader of All of Us, to be that parental figure, and tell All of Us to shape up. Stick your head out that two hundredth floor window and yell, 'listen up everybody, we&#039;re not going to be like Gerald anymore.' Get on that special red phone connected directly to Humanity and say, 'it&#039;s time to stop being a bunch of assholes, all seven billion of you.' Tell your Secretary of Manning-up to get off his nonexistent ass and get to work. Open your eyes, bring yourself into existence, grab this planet by its giant blue marbles, and make it a better place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#039;t just do it for me. Don&#039;t do it for the children. Do it because if you don&#039;t do it people are going to call you a 'lame duck' or a 'socialist' or a 'made-up.' Do it because if you don&#039;t we&#039;re all going to kill ourselves (I don&#039;t mean we&#039;re all going to commit suicide, I mean we&#039;re going to destroy ourselves by being assholes) if you don&#039;t. Do it because I really want an iron man suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, I really just want an iron man suit. Thank you in advance for making that happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='margin-bottom: 0px'>Shauvon McGill</p>\r\n<p style='margin-top: 0px'>DenyConformity.com</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

      "title": "McGill family farm journal",
      "text": "<p>My parents have been doing some research into my family&#039;s history, recently. They uncovered some interesting things, as well as a genealogical line stretching all the way back to when people had names like GRONGNARD. One of the more interesting things they found, though, was a journal detailing one of my ancestor&#039;s trials as they moved west to start a new life, during, presumably, the Great Depression. I found it fascinating, especially during this time of great economic turmoil. I urge you to read ahead, and get a glimpse at a bit of history. It&#039;s actually somewhat well written, too.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Week one.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sun set slowly over the modest parcel of land that held far too much of my family&#039;s future as we arrived this week to start our new life here. I looked across this small farmland which was recently handed to me, and I felt an all to familiar twinge of fear rise in the pit of my stomach. How could my family and I survive on this meager patch of dirt and the few simple crops that were planted here before my arrival? I decided to waste no time, or perhaps decided that there simply was no time to waste. In the fading evening sun, as my wife and children settled themselves in our new house - it still seemed far too small for our four children - I set out to survey what little we had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was given a paltry few instructions to aid me. I could only guess what most of my tools were for. Thankfully, a small patch of vegetables was already growing, and I decided that what little I could discover from them could be invaluable when I need to plant more. I only hope the small bit of coin I can get for harvesting these plants will be enough to keep my children fed over the coming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife and I have been married for almost fifteen years. We met when I was still working for the Bank, back East. It was a simpler time then, and we were blissfully happy, slowly raising a family on my Generous Banker's Salary. Then, as the economy began taking its toll on us all, the warm burn in the pit of my stomach first showed itself. My wife often found me at the window, gazing off at the skyline. She always had the same nervous look on her face, and I knew she was only mirroring my own. I have a tendency to stop blinking when I'm worried, and she knew it. She would stare into my big, pale-blue eyes, and know that something was wrong. Neither of us could have guessed just how bad things were going to become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has, in more recent days, become cruelly apparent that I know nothing about raising a farm. I tried several times to replant the small patches of land that I had recently harvested, before I finally felt confident in my work. My oldest son, Jeffery, proved to be invaluable to me by heading to the nearest town, where a market provides me and other local farmers with the resources we need. Unfortunately, he was only able to find soybeans, and we had to spend an unfortunate amount of money to re-plant them. I looked on with great trepidation, hoping to whatever omniscient beings watching over us that these soybeans - our only option - would prove valuable. The planting took a great deal of what little money we had, but I hoped that the investment and the experience gained would more than make up for it. Only time would tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My contact in town, the old man who gave me the few tips I had about farming going into this new life, left me with some words of encouragement. 'That&#039;s farming for ya!' he told me, but somehow I am not entirely confident in my achievements so far. I will have to be vigilant, and harvest these little crops as soon as they are ready, which I fear will be the hardest challenge yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still wonder if these new crops will require some sort of maintenance that I have not yet been made aware of. I cannot tell if these tools I have available can help me to water the crops, protect them from weeds or insects, or other seemingly obvious challenges that could present themselves. The old man in town simply told me to harvest the crops before they wither, which struck me as rather obvious, frankly. What little I knew about farms covered the simple concept of plant, wait, harvest, without any wizened 'expert' to help me. Do I simply wait, standing here on my new land, my deep, blue eyes staring unblinking at the horizon, until that moment comes that I can spring to action and harvest these crops that my entire family is depending on? Is there nothing I can do to occupy my fretting mind in the meanwhile? This will truly be a difficult time.</p>",

      "title": "High Dynamic Range",
      "text": "<p>I enjoy Photography. Hopefully, and judging by the fact that you&#039;re here (and haven&#039;t said 'this website sucks' yet), you enjoy my photography. Well, I have good news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, it isn&#039;t 'I haven&#039;t updated my website in like a billion forevers.'</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I have learned how to use High Dynamic Range.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ok, so what is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging'>High Dynamic Range</a>? Well, for those of you who haven&#039;t opened that link in another tab and read the Wikipedia article about it, High Dynamic Range Imagery (or HDRI (or HDR)) is a type of image with extremely high . . . dynamic range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so a digital photograph is a pretty complicated thing. When a digital camera opens its lens and allows a few billion photons (particles of light) to hit its image sensor, the sensor turns those photons into electrons, and those electrons get processed and stored on a flash card or whatever. That&#039;s, in theory, exactly the same way analog photography happens, except instead of electrons you&#039;re storing image data in magic photo-sensitive chemicals. The problem with digital photography is that when you do that processing, you&#039;re throwing away something like most of the actual image data (I was going to throw a number in there like 75%, but the fact is that I don&#039;t really know exactly how much it is). That&#039;s fine for pictures of your friend&#039;s sweet <a href='http://www.google.com/images?q=beeramid&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1186&bih=830'>beeramid</a> that you&#039;re going to post on Facebook. It&#039;s not, however, good for people who really <em>care</em> about their photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those people, the people who carry around a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCumH8LRo1A'>mini-Victrola</a> and who won&#039;t eat food that was cooked on Thursdays or whatever, there just is no comparison between digital and analog film. Yeah, ok, so CD&#039;s can&#039;t ever sound like records, and analog film will always be superior to digital cameras, no matter how many magipixels you cram in them. Whatever. Eat a bowl of dicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uh, sorry. It&#039;s pretty late and I was up late last night taking pictures of this sweet church (I&#039;ll get to that). Anyway, you can get good pictures from a digital camera (hopefully I am proof of that, I only shoot on digital), and the instant gratification and speedy camera-to-facebook turnaround time makes up for any lack of quality. Also, good digital cameras are pretty much dirt cheap now (compared, at least, to what cameras used to cost). Shooting in <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00148'>RAW</a> can make sure that your camera throws away as little data as possible, too. (I just realized that I posted those sweet RAW photos just over four years ago. Sheesh)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that there&#039;s only so much information you can cram pack into an image file (particularly JPEGs; you should avoid them and stick with PNGs or TIFFs). What can you do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter HDRI (or High Dynamic Range Imagery (or HDR)). Using this super sweet tutorial (yes, this is a JOHN TURTURROIAL), you can turn three pictures into one picture, and thereby theoretically TRIPPPLE the Dynamic Range of your image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, you need a camera that allows you to control the Aperture Value (and probably the Shutter Speed, too). Most cameras these days grant you that. If you camera allows you to use 'Exposure Bracketing' you can do this much easier. Look it up in your camera&#039;s manual or on the internet. You&#039;ll also probably need Photoshop, but you can probably do it with some other programs out there (if anybody brings up the <a href='http://www.gimp.org/'>GIMP</a>, I will stab you). You&#039;ll need a tripod, too, unless you&#039;re some kind of robot. If you&#039;re some kind of robot, please call me I want to be friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, get your tripod set up and point your camera at something cool. Something like . . . an old church that&#039;s down the street from where I live (I told you I&#039;d get back to that).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#039;re going to take three quick pictures of the same thing, which is why the tripod helps (any difference in the pictures&#039; content will screw things up). Put your camera into either Aperture Priority or Manual mode, and turn off the auto-focus (the aperture value and focal depth cannot change between pictures). I&#039;ll repeat that outside of some parentheses: The aperture value and focal depth cannot change between pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, you&#039;re going to take three identical pictures (with one slight difference). When the three get processed together in Photoshop, they will become one. It is therefore crucial that the pictures be identical as possible (anything moving in the frame can be DISASTROUS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what changes? What&#039;s the what? Well, take a look at your camera&#039;s Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) setting. It allows you to turn the little bar specifying how to expose your picture into THREE LITTLE BARS! That means the camera will automatically set up your camera to take three pictures: one normally-exposed, one under-exposed, and one over-exposed. Set that to something between 1.5 and 2, depending on how much dynamic range you want. Now, simply push the shutter button three times (waiting for the camera to save the image each time), and it will make sure they&#039;re exposed properly, by changing the exposure setting (and the aperture, if you didn&#039;t force it to use the same one (which is why you need to force it to use a specific aperture (by using the Aperture Priority, or Manual modes) each time) each time) each time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so you now have three seemingly identical images, with one minor difference. They&#039;re exposed to different levels, within a specific range. What the dealyo is here is that the under-exposed image will look really sweet in the bright areas, and the over-exposed image will look really sweet in the dark areas, and the normal image will look really sweet in the normal areas. Let&#039;s take a look at three images I took last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/13.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>Normal, Under-exposed, and Over-exposed. Since this is a night scene, we don&#039;t get a great deal of dynamic range (it works best with a sweet sky and daylight) but whatever. It&#039;s some some dark bits, some bright bits, and some regular bits. What we&#039;re going to do is bring them into Photoshop using a thing called Merge to HDR, which is under File - Automate (in versions since like CS2 or something).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/0.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>You get this dialog box. As you can see, I&#039;ve loaded three images into it already. They&#039;re the three images I took! By the way, you can process these images in the RAW utility to adjust the white balance and stuff like that if you want, just be sure you use the exact same settings on all three so that they don&#039;t get WEIRDED OUT by the merging process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some crazy magic technotronic stuff happens you get another dialog box with a picture in it. Mine looked like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/1.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>'Wait, that doesn&#039;t really look that good at all. What the crap, Shauvon?!' - You, just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shut up, you, we&#039;re not done yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/2.PNG' /> \r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s this little dude up there in the corner of your new dialog box, you see. This guy helps you adjust the white point of your new image. Basically, it controls how much of each picture to blend into the final one. Since mine is a little bright (most of mine seem to be pretty bright, probably because I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing), I&#039;m going to slide it to the right. Adjust yours to taste - I mean until it looks good.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/3.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s what mine looked like after I did that thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/4.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>See, the little bar is farther to the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you&#039;re going to freak out some more. I sure did. The problem is that the little preview window can&#039;t really show you what the picture looks like (in fact, once the HDRI is made, no consumer-level monitor on the planet can actually show you what it really looks like). It&#039;s just an approximation, thrown together at the last minute like most of my papers in College. Particularly, black levels look like poop levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/5.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>See, total poop level. When I first started playing around with this, disappointment levels were high at this point. I promise you, though, you just have to stick with it. Once you hit OK, and some more fanciful whiz-bang happens, you get your super image.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/6.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s what I got. Yeah, it&#039;s ok, but not really that different from what my regular flat photograph was (the farthest to the left in that trippple-picture up above). The reason this doesn&#039;t look like much is because there&#039;s a <em>substantial</em> amount of the image that your computer just can&#039;t show you. I think that&#039;s really awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a digital camera takes a picture, it throws something like a bunch of the data away. Remember when I said that? Those were good times. Anyway, the reason this happens is because that data is beyond the limits of what human technology, or even biology, can handle. Your eye just can&#039;t see detail beyond that (something that kind of pokes holes in those analog-purists rants). The thing is, though, that what you can&#039;t see, your computer <em>can</em>. So when we process those three pictures into one mega-picture (or MECHAPICTURE), we&#039;re cram-packing it full of delicious COMPUTER FOOD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a regular JPEG image (or any regular computer format) has 8 bits per channel. Each pixel is represented by three channels, Red, Green, and Blue (and also an alpha channel in the case of images like PNGs or Gifs), and each of those channels gets 8 bits (or one Byte) to describe it. That&#039;s plenty for literally every image you&#039;ve ever seen, because that&#039;s as much as computer displays can display (if you&#039;ve heard the term '32-bit' that&#039;s just adding up the three channels and an 8-bit alpha channel together).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture we just Frankensteined together is now 32 bits per channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ll let that sink in. Yes, this picture has four times the depth of any picture ever (hyperbole!). Remember, you can&#039;t see that extra data, and your monitor can&#039;t display it, which is why it looks pretty similar to the regular old 8 bit per channel image you yanked out of the camera (and the funny thing about this is that when I screen-shotted these HDR images out of Photoshop, I had to save them out at 8 bit per channel to show them here, so I can&#039;t even really show you what I&#039;m talking about). Your computer isn&#039;t limited by crappy human eyes, though, so it can see all the bits it wants (and the funny thing about <em>that</em> is that most of the pictures on the internet are about looking at all of the bits that the average teenage boy wants). We can tell the computer to process this puppy into something really sweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/7.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>And, Mr. Skeptic, there&#039;s that same bit of the sky from before, and it looks substantially less poop-y. I told you to trust me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we need to do is tell the computer to turn that 32 bit per channel MECHAPICTURE into a regular old run of the mill 8 bits per channel PICTUREPICTURE.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/8.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s a screenshot of me doing that!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/9.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>You get another dialog box, now. This one tells the computer what sort of algorithm to use when it turns all those 32 bits into 8 bits (basically, which bits to use, and which bits to throw out). Normally, your camera does this bit-throwing when it takes a picture, so by having more control over it, we can make a much cooler shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/processed_expgama_small.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s my picture, processed with the default setting: 'Exposure and Gamma.' It definitely has more dynamic range than the original, and it is a pretty good picture, but it&#039;s not the best (trust me).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/10.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>We have four options to choose, so let&#039;s see what happens when we try them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/processed_highlightcomp_small.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Highlight Compression takes all the highlights and . . . well . . . compresses them. Basically we have just a darker version of the image from before. Eh.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/processed_equalize_small.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Equalize Histogram flattens the histogram, which in this case is a bad idea since a lot of the image is black (so it tries to brighten the whole thing). Not the right choice for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spoiler alert: the next option is the awesome one.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/processed_localadaptation_small.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Local Adaptation, my friends. It takes all of the detail and makes it super sharp and awesomeified. Shut up that&#039;s a word. What&#039;s more, you have a handy toning curve right there that you can use to adjust the image (the default version is a little flat, so I tweaked it to get it a little better). Here are my settings:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/11.PNG' />\r\n\r\n<p>The Radius and Threshold settings are what makes it look super sweet (everything gets a sort of 'bloom' effect halo around it), so grind those up nice and high. Here&#039;s what the picture looks like with those settings:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/processed_localadaptation_curves_small.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Awesome? Yes. Worth the work? Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so there you have it. With a little modification and attention, you can turn three pictures into one picture, and look really awesome in the process. I should mention, of course, that this will not make up for you being a bad photographer. A poorly framed High Dynamic Range Image is still a crappy picture. Sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a comparison of three versions of the file. Left is the regular, flat photograph. Center is the HDRI before it was processed. Right is the processed, awesome, MECHAPHOTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/12.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, some more leveling and tweaking can be done to the final image, but I wanted to show you how much was capable just processing the HDR images without any touching-up afterwords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some more examples. Keep in mind that the only 'Photoshopping' that I did to these was a little tweaking to white balance in the RAW files and the processes shown in this Tuturroial.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/hdr2_small.png' />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/hdr3_small.png' />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<img src='../assets/images/hdri/hdr4_small.png' />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>HDRI is really sweet. Some dudes even made a <a href='http://vimeo.com/14821961'>movie</a> with it. It&#039;s not really practical for taking pictures of your broselburgh&#039;s latest facebook profile picture, but for taking really elegant, highly detailed photographs of big, sweet things (like churches), it&#039;s about as good as you&#039;re going to get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you think? Is it worth all the trouble?</p>",

      "title": "Google Voice",
      "text": "<p>So, I use Google Voice. It&#039;s a phone thing that does things for your phone thing. Whatever. One of the things it does is transcribe your voicemails to you, so you don&#039;t have to listen to them (if you don&#039;t know why that would be useful, don&#039;t bother asking). The problem is that it&#039;s sometimes really bad at converting text to speech. Usually it can get the idea across, and it&#039;s quite accurate at transcribing addresses and phone numbers correctly, which is great. However, sometimes you get something pretty hilarious. I just went through my back catalog of voicemails (since Google never deletes anything, everything&#039;s still there). Here&#039;s one that Andrew Monkey left me the other night:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'It&#039;s. Thanks John, I was just wondering where you are exactly. If you have a job in Sean and Jonathan job and jocelyn, Job, and For the Hughes y&#039;all then. Anyway, we&#039;re just wondering where you are so that we come and get you at some point, or rather, 1. Employee have my wife come and get you and so I&#039;m going to, so give me a call back on. I love you bye bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or this one, which I got from Alyson a month and a half ago:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Right. It&#039;s me to for the same a cancerous Karen love you. Thanks bye bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes they&#039;re just as incoherent as the incompetent people who leave them, like this slurry call from a UPS employee about a package they failed to do their jobs and deliver to me:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hi. This os does, or I, calling for U. P. S. In regards to your call. I&#039;m giving you the info notice from yesterday. Because, Today. After 6 o&#039;clock would be too late for use the process your package off to the address info another number is </em>*Long, actually accurate number*<em>. If you have any questions regarding this package. Please call us at 31 so 942-7554. Thank you. Have a nice day bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s actually pretty close to the message, and like I said, the numbers were transcribed accurately (except for '312' becoming '31 so' but really, I listened to the message and it certainly sounds like Google got it right). Go ahead and call that number if you&#039;re a jack ass, it&#039;s just a UPS hub in Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more alarming ones was this one from my boss (the only time he has ever called me), three months ago:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hey shopping at skirts, apparently there was some last minute changes better. Just a very minor to where to buy check your email. I think there is services there also have lunch with you in the mail. I don&#039;t know what the time line on this is, but I think it&#039;s I talked to lover and he called and So if you just feel like a Really quick free minute thing that we need to get done, anyhow. Give me a call </em>*Accurate Phone number*<em> Thanks man. Bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice seems to have the most trouble with my name. God knows why. Here&#039;s a few:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hey job in call us back as soon as possible please. Thanks.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Ray, home. It&#039;s me, Allison. In case you didn&#039;t recognize, mavenwire 8 just calling to talk, okay.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hi Jonathan, This is Alison I was calling to talk and I hope you&#039;re doing World.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s a message from Alyson from about 4 months ago:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hi it&#039;s me. I&#039;m. I was in the grocery store and I saw that I think you&#039;re liking it. Maybe even think of you, but also I was calling because it&#039;s something that I remember this is like, you can see it tonight. I really wanted to let you know cos i was like sitting around. I&#039;ve put all those girls last and talking. If I don&#039;t appreciate if nothing else alright. She had one Kuwaitis like talking one Blackstock and I&#039;d like to do that over time issues. I guess. I was out of look it up where 11 Blackstock online. Bye and I&#039;d like to find out something very special. Does that what and I got really excited, alright. Love you. Bye bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody&#039;s always telling me they love me. When Google becomes self aware and takes over humanity hopefully it will keep that in mind. It will be systematically destroying all humans, but when it gets to me - you know, Jonathan 'Job in' Ray Home - it will realize just how important we all are and it will learn how to love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have absolutely no idea what this one is about, or who it was from:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'Hi, This message truck. It&#039;s just comes to the sector. Elite and built in 61 until 7:30 zero close tomorrow and 10 3730. Again, thanks bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the message is about some specific directions which become incredibly hard to follow:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>Hey she doesn&#039;t know, she your phone message I&#039;ve ever heard, we are heading over to software now there&#039;s a bar best restaurant that Pat wants to go to. That&#039;s on software as sort of near the tracks, but not back to the place about it says Street. We are on the name of the we&#039;ve been there once it&#039;s pretty good, so we&#039;re gonna have there when you&#039;re at your place and you know you want to eat. Give me a call and you can meet up or we could figure out something out but we&#039;re definitely gonna gonna blow up your felt alright. See you in a bit. Bye.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these could be songs. Others couldn&#039;t be anything, like this one, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, from Alyson:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='width: 500px'><em>'A Yeah, hey, hey hey and he him up black and and and. I want We&#039;re, and because I haven&#039;t things worked out, and with Yeah, well. Hey, in there Y DE LA lap. That You and me and and i just stop the work that going on. Because that was a.

And then I have a bearing on the he&#039;s the error.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#039;t bother trying to figure out what that meant. I have no idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s apparently some sort of algorithm that sorts out and removes 'um's and 'uh's, because those almost never show up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the moral of this is that people need to enunciate more.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t",

So when I want to take an HDR set, I can use that to just take all three pictures really fast - fast enough that I can hold it steady just in my hands. HDR sans tripod. I think it worked reasonably well. Just compare the next picture with the last one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'>\r\n<img src='../assets/images/sky/sky_hdr_small.jpg' height='533' width='800'></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'>\r\n<img src='../assets/images/sky/sky_hdr2_small.jpg' height='1201' width='800'></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you think?

      "text": "<p>My parents live in the middle of nowhere. They like it because it&#039;s nice and remote, and they get to see plenty of wildlife. My parents love wildlife. They love the deer, the birds, and the turtles. They love everything . . . except the snakes. It turns out my Mom hates snakes. Keep that in mind for a moment. After the following digression, we&#039;ll get back to the snake thing (trust me, it will be worth it).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Keep reading (there are pictures!)</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Not too long ago, a random cat wandered into my parents&#039; lives (as random cats are want to do). They named the cat Bartley. He reminds me of that <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719606/'>red-haired kid</a> from old 90&#039;s movies like <em>The Sandlot</em>. That guy (his name is Patrick Renna) always played semi-obnoxious red-headed chubby kids. That&#039;s Bartley. The dude&#039;s a little feline con-artist. He&#039;ll stop at nothing to get you to pay attention to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you walk across my parents&#039; yard, there&#039;s Bartley. He&#039;ll run right under your feet, doing that little 'rub all up on you' thing that cats do to your legs. That&#039;s totally fine if you&#039;re just standing there. He&#039;ll just do the figure-eight while you gaze absently at the sunset. If you walking, though, it&#039;s pretty much a one-way ticket to Tripsville, and you&#039;re the guest of honor. It&#039;s a popular place, that Tripsville. While you&#039;re there, say 'hi' to the <a href='http://www.schwans.com/'>ice-cream man</a>, the meter-reader, and those Jehovah&#039;s Witnesses who came by that one time. Then, while you&#039;re on the ground nursing your twisted ankle or compound fracture or whatever, Bartley will come sauntering by, all, 'hey, while you&#039;re there, you can pat me.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you leave something sitting on the ground in my parents&#039; yard, there&#039;s Bartley. He&#039;ll come sit on it, or in it, or against it (whichever is more obnoxious). He&#039;ll just sit there, waiting for you, knowing that you&#039;ll have to pick him up to get him out of the way. What happens when you pick him up to get him out of the way? You are now patting Bartley. What&#039;s that? You were just picking him up to throw him across the yard? Close enough. Alyson and I stopped at my parents&#039; house on our trip from Boulder with a car-full of stuff from her apartment. We opened the back door of Alyson&#039;s car to take some stuff out to leave in the barn for a few months while we figure out where we&#039;re going to live. We were away from the car for all of 90 seconds. Guess where Bartley was when we got back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Get out of there, Bartley!' I yelled. That never works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you open a door to the house - yes, any door - there&#039;s Bartley. He&#039;s not allowed in the house on account of his being a 'goddamn pain in the ass.' He is therefore on constant alert, psychically knowing exactly when and where someone will be exiting or entering the house. As soon as the door opens, in he darts. Don&#039;t worry, he&#039;s not trying to get into the house. He&#039;s just there so you&#039;ll pat him, doing a stealthy, acrobatic figure-eight around your legs as you walk through the door. Welcome back to Tripsville. I see this time you brought some guests: the groceries you were carrying in from the car. Then, when you gather up the sundry articles which have been cast across the floor, you&#039;ll have to gather up a little orange butt-hole, too. Bartley wins again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a bit of a theme with Bartley, the whole being a butt-hole thing. He&#039;ll beat up any other cat he meets, and brutally murder pretty much anything smaller than him. My Mom was pretty upset the day she saw him leaping up at a hummingbird, hovering about five feet above the ground. When my parents go on one of their regular walks around the huge woods behind their house, Bartley comes along, ready to be patted whenever they stop for a moment. He&#039;ll dart down any hole or burrow he finds, sticking his head into some little creature&#039;s house, I guess just to say 'hey guys, Bartley&#039;s here!' I&#039;ve even seen Bartley rubbing up against my parents&#039; dog, Teddy, who is honesty one the most terrifying creature on the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&#039;s the only cat my Mom has ever seen just go hang out <em>inside</em> the chicken coop. <strong>Inside.</strong> Imagine if you tried to go to your bedroom and a serious predator who is literally <em>the size of you</em> is there, just hanging out. He doesn&#039;t mess with the chickens, he just goes there, presumably, because he&#039;s a butt-hole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wish I could have been there the time Bartley apparently decided to go walk across the ice-covered creek, only to find out that the ice wasn&#039;t quite thick enough to support the weight of a chubby, obnoxious cat. Yeah, they had a good laugh, but he probably did it on purpose because they ended up carrying him back to the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody is even really sure where Bartley came from. My Mom thinks he&#039;s the reincarnation of a cat who died right before Bartley showed up, as a kitten (an already very obnoxious kitten). The cat was very old, looked a lot like Bartley, and was also pretty obnoxious. It&#039;s not entirely absurd, to be honest. Still, it was probably much less interesting than that. I think Bartley&#039;s original owner was just completely fed up with Tripsville and decided to dump Bartley so far out in the middle of nowhere that he&#039;d surely never trouble anything again. I think Bartley is the kind of animal that will never be stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, Bartley is a real pain in the butt. My Mom still loves him, though. Remember how she hates snakes? Well, what can she do when she&#039;s working out in the yard and she sees the spine-tingling sight of a snake slithering past?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, she doesn&#039;t have to call for Bartley, because he&#039;s already there, trying to get her to pat him. He&#039;ll give that up for a few minutes, though, to play with (and eventually murder) whatever creatures turn up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This just so happened while I was staying there a couple weeks ago. My Mom told me to come check something out, so I grabbed my camera and followed her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here are some pictures of Bartley having fun with this new toy my Mom found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7025.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7027.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7031.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7033.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7042.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7047.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7049.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7052.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7054.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7064.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#039;s really crazy is that Bartley actually was just playing with the poor snake. He tossed it around and bit at it like a shoelace somebody was dangling right there for him to pounce. It seemed eerily similar, except that this shoelace was alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7068.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would sit there for a while, let it slowly try to make for the safety of the grass, and then pounce, carrying it back to the middle of the walkway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7073.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7074.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, it would try to fight back. It would bite at Bartley&#039;s nose, sometimes dangling there for a minute. Without teeth, though (as you can see in some of these pictures), it didn&#039;t have much hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7077.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7078.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'><img src='../assets/images/cat_n_snake/small_IMG_7080.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there you go. That&#039;s Bartley. The cat that no one wants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just so you know, the snake actually did get away. Eventually Bartley got bored, and the snake was able to make it to safety. Probably Bartley was more interested getting me to stop taking pictures and start patting him.</p>",

It&#039;s cool that something I&#039;ve made is still going after six long years. This is only my 266th post, which comes to only 44 posts a year (minus the ones I made back in &#039;04 / &#039;05 when this was just a page on my Purdue-hosted web space). I hope to post a lot more in the next six years. I want DenyConformity.com to be a place where people can be entertained, and that means I will have to start posting higher-quality material much more regularly. Also, I need to get around to doing some of the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00230'>things</a> I promised a long time ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This old bird&#039;s been through a lot, and this clunky old design is sure showing its age.

However, that&#039;s not what DenyConformity.com is <em>about</em>. I built this site, six years ago, as a place for me to experiment. I can experiment with writing; I can experiment with ideas; I can experiment with design. Also, since the site doesn&#039;t get many users a month, it&#039;s not like I really have much to lose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&acirc;€™ll document my progress rebuilding this place from the ground up, just in case anybody out there is interested in the process, or in case somebody sees the new site and screams, 'what?!'

      "text": "<p>This is part two in my ongoing journal documenting the redesign of DenyConformity.com. Think of it as the audio commentary track for the Internet. Today we&#039;ll discuss the history of DenyConformity.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DenyConformity.com is certainly not exactly as it was when I built it six years ago. Many features have been added or tweaked. I went and dug up my old post where I outlined my goals for the site (from May 12, 2005). Here&#039;s what I wanted, originally:</p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n<li><strong>PHP scripting</strong> - Nobody knows what it really stands for, but it kicks ass, so I&#039;m using it.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>NO FRAMES</strong> - Everyone hates frames, especially the web designers who have to wade through the billions of files that they create.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Easy Comment system</strong> - I don&#039;t think anyone has actually tried, but all over the site I have little comment links. They don&#039;t work, in case you haven&#039;t noticed. With PHP I can change that!</li>\r\n    <li><strong>More symbols</strong> - I will spam my symbol all over the place, even more than I already have!</li>\r\n    <li><strong>No Splash page</strong> - I&#039;m getting rid of the stupid page that just says 'ENTER' on it.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Easier Navigation</strong> - The menu will be easier to use, and I&#039;m turning the portfolio into a sepparate site.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>More stuff of the moment</strong> - I&#039;ll have a whole slew of '*blank* of the moment' stuff. Right now I just have a joke and a poem of the moment.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Better look</strong> - I&#039;m bored with my current look, and I hope you are too because it&#039;s changing.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>More pictures</strong> - I&#039;ve tried to put as many pictures as I could into this site, but I&#039;m going to have even more once I have my own digital camera to take them with.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Higher compatibility</strong> - the new site will work equally perfect on any browser you view it with (provided it is up to date). I still believe that Firefox is the BEST browser ever, but a lot of people use Internet Explorer too.</li>\r\n    <li>And much much more!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I still can&#039;t believe I used to have a splash page. I&#039;m very tempted to let my old site be forgotten forever, but I do still have it, and you can still <a href='/other/oldsite/home.htm'>see</a> it. Reading through my old posts makes me realize how much of a moron I used to be (I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m such a moron, future me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, so I think I managed to take care of the things in my old list. I built a PHP commenting system from scratch without ever having used PHP or MySQL before, which I&#039;m still marginally proud of. I was also able to build a semi-decent dropdown menu with Javascript, which was a pretty cool thing for me at the time. I am really sick of the site&#039;s current 'look' but it&#039;s sure as Hell better than the <a href='/other/oldsite/home.htm'>old one</a> was (I reiterate my extreme uneasiness at having my old site still available). Anything would have looked better than that monstrosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/menu.jpg' /></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>The 'cool' kind of dropdown box.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in ought-five I didn&#039;t even have a name for my website. I tried to ask for ideas on my old web blight, but of course my parents didn&#039;t have any thoughts, so my audience wasn&#039;t much help. The site was originally hosted on the 500 megabyte space Purdue University gave me for being a student there. When I was working on the new site, it originally just said 'Shauvon McGill' up there where it says 'DenyConformity' now. It wasn&#039;t till that summer that I remembered an old slogan I used to use when I was in High School. Sure enough, DenyConformity.com was available, and that was that. With a lack of a better idea, and delusions of grandeur rapidly forming in my head, I figured it was a great idea. It could be worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few elements of my site are not quite what I would consider 'successful.' I originally intended to have tons of these weekly things. I thought I&#039;d post poems on Monday, jokes on Tuesday, discussions on Thursday (I&#039;d skip Wednesday), and then pictures on Friday. That&#039;s one of those things that make me call myself a moron. You can guess how long I kept that up. Also on the site is the 'about' section, containing outdated and embarrassing pictures of me and some other sections that nobody should really care about. Of course, through it all, there&#039;s that stupid dropdown box for picking old posts, constantly reminding my visitors what the Internet was like in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/dropdown.jpg' /></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>The 'terrible' kind of dropdown box.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The one thing I would say I&#039;m actually still happy with is the background image, which is selected randomly from a pool of 90 pictures. The way it&#039;s set up isn&#039;t great, and a lot of them make text hard to read over them, but I think it gives an interesting bit of flavor to the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I continued to expand my 'vision' for DenyConformity.com. Pretty early on (around November, 2005), I built the update system, so you can see what&#039;s new at a glance. In an odd attempt to promote the site as more of an entertainment blog than an angsty / stupid one, I started to 'feature' certain posts in May, 2006. You can see what&#039;s featured in the stupid dropdown box. My thought at the time was to make it easier to get to posts which I think are more interesting (like, for some reason, a billion pictures of <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00134'>bald-me</a>). Eventually I decided that every post should be something I think is interesting, so I shouldn&#039;t have to do that anymore. That&#039;s one of those 'well duh' moments, when you look back on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'People aren&#039;t going to flock to a website where a guy constantly complains about how much of a loser he thinks he is?' asks me-five-years-ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'No.' I respond. 'No, they aren&#039;t. They will go to here, however, for a website where . . .' I look expectantly at me-five-years-from-now. ' . . . a guy constantly . . . does . . . funny . . . ?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m not as wise as you, Future Me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second half of 2006, my web idol Rob Cockerham commented on <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00146'>one</a> of my posts. It was a pretty big moment for me, as his site, <a href='http://www.cockeyed.com'>cockeyed.com</a>, is still one of the models for the type of content I would like to produce here. I hope it really was him, and not just some wacko trying to freak me out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, DenyConformity.com hit its second major website milestone: it was found by spam bots. It <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=158'>started</a> in the Discussion page, which nobody ever saw anyway, so I took it down. Then the bots started hitting my blog posts, which meant something had to be done. That summer, in July, 2007, I built the official DenyConformity.com CAPTCHA system, to keep them out. It&#039;s a bit different than usual CAPTCHAs, so I was curious to see if it would work. It&#039;s an example of one of the things I&#039;ve experimented with here. I&#039;d say it was successful. Not a single spam post has been made since the CAPTCHA went up. I haven&#039;t heard any complaints about it, either, so the four of you seem to be able to manage it well enough. I think the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00172'>post</a> where I explain the CAPTCHA system might be the nerdiest post on this entire site, at least in terms of sheer references (can you name them all?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have changed the background image you see behind the CAPTCHA every year since I introduced them. It turns out that yearly is the most often I can regularly make updates to the site. Here are all of the backgrounds I&#039;ve used since 2007 (when they started):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/captcha_07.gif' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/captcha_08.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/captcha_09.jpg' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/captcha_10.gif' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/dc_history/captcha_11.gif' /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is your favorite? My favorite is from 2010. I was unemployed at the time, so I had plenty of time to make a cool looking thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, 2009, I added the <a href='http://denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00220'>Twitter box</a> to the main page of the site. Since then my parents and employers have been able to keep track of me moment by moment. That may not have worked out great all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have also been a few more minor tweaks through the years. Around the time of the CAPTCHA implementation, I added the ability to apply formatting to your comments. In the almost four years since then, I don&#039;t think anybody has used that ability once. Also around that time I added the XHTML 1.1 and CSS 3 compliance badges, which I was pretty proud to be able to sport. I will probably have to devote a chapter of this Journal to my thoughts on modern web standards. A bit later, I added the links in the footer to other areas of the 'DenyConformity Entertainment Network' which is partly a joke, and also partly my delusions of grandeur. In 2009, I finally implemented an <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00207'>RSS feed</a> into the site, so people could keep track of updates more easily.

Act now! Up to TWO (2) sacks of old computer cords! Free!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FREE:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two sacks of random computer cords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USB! Firewire! Parallel! Serial*! RCA! PS2! Lots, Lots more (maybe)! These sacks each contain a random tangle of numerous old wires and plugs. There&#039;s all kinds of cables in these sacks. I think I see a webcam there, and also some USB brackets. These would be a perfect gift for Cable Enthusiasts, Copper Addicts, and 'Connector Collectors.' I would love to see these sacks go to a good home. Tell me when and where, and I&#039;ll meet you there with a sack in each hand so you can pick which one you want. I will be willing to swap some cables from one sack to the other if you are kind of a greedy dude, but don&#039;t go crazy. I&#039;m not in this just to swap stuff from sack to sack all day. Seriously, greedy dude, just pick a sack and live with what you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These sacks are great. They have maybe fifty cables each, and each cable has (at least) one connector on each end. That&#039;s like twice as many connectors! These sacks would be great for people who like wires, but obviously they would be even better (twice as better) for people who like plugs and stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get one for the kids! Toss them a sack and tell them to go start untangling. That&#039;ll shut them up. Also they&#039;ll get a history lesson about the different number of prongs you can pack into S-Video connectors! When they&#039;re done, tell them to tangle them back up for later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are perfect for movie props! Your characters can use them to hack the internet! Tie some to a few road flares and a clock and you have a great fake bomb!** Use them in your sketch you wrote about a guy trying to hock useless old cables on Craigslist. Some of this stuff might help you get closer to finishing that Borg costume you&#039;ve been working on for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toss one at your friend! See what he does. I don&#039;t know, maybe he&#039;s the kind of guy who likes having sacks of wires thrown at him.*** Try it out with a friend you don&#039;t like very much first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carry them around with you all over town. People will ask you to help them with their computer problems all the time probably. Nothing says 'I know computers' like a rocking a couple of cable sacks, akimbo-style. They&#039;ll be all, 'hey, you look like you can help me set up my printer!' Imagine how superior to them you&#039;ll feel when you tell them to screw off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My life was a pointless, directionless blur before I got these cables. The mere thought of potentially not having a MOLEX to SATA adapter kept me huddling under the covers. I spent almost 15 years trying to get one of every cable. Then I realized that was a kind of stupid quest. Then I got into comic books. Then I became the type of guy who hocks useless old cables on Craigslist because he&#039;s bored. They can do the same for you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should warn you that the sacks have some holes in them. They can barely contain the number of cables inside. That&#039;s surely 8 - 10% more cables than the next guy. Your neighbors, your friends, even your coworkers will be shamed by the pure inadequacy of their cable sacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would horde this amazing collection all for myself, but I&#039;m moving in with my girlfriend and she told me I have to cut down on my collection of 'useless old junk.' Better make room for face cream and laserjet prints of Justin Bieber, am I right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act now (or ever) and I&#039;ll throw in an old CPU heatsink for each sack. Keep one in your purse to brain potential muggers (like I always say, 'if you brain them now, they won&#039;t mug you later'). Use them to keep things slightly cooler, like power transformers, sub-woofers, and battlemechs. Strap them to your head to totally stick it to those jerk-wads who keep calling you a 'hothead.' Melt them down and you&#039;ll have like 8 ounces of actual aluminum which you can forge into seriously anything. I&#039;m basically giving you your wildest aluminum dreams. You should be paying me.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>*This item is not to be mixed with milk and eaten for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.<br>\r\n**This is not to be used in any way to build an actual explosive device.<br>\r\n***I am not responsible for any lost friendships or 'falling outs' that happen as a result of these sacks being tossed.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\n",

      "title": "Halloween Costume 2011, Part 1",
      "text": "\n\n<p>Halloween is coming up in a couple weeks, and this year Alyson and I are going to Nashville to a big party a friend of hers is throwing. I decided that I had better get a good costume together, because of how much I hate looking the fool in front of people. For the last few days, I&#039;ve been working on a new costume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will be going as a tree this year. I thought about keeping it a secret and letting you just guess what I will be from the pictures, but it will be pretty obvious when you start to see it. Alyson and I went off to the craft store to stock up on supplies and hot glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/plan1.jpg' height='841' width='650'><br><br><img src='../assets/images/costume/plan2.jpg' height='593' width='650'><br>\r\nHere are some quick sketches of my plan. My body will be the trunk, and my head and arms will be branches. I figured I would make, essentially, a suit of armor out of cardboard, and then decorate it to look like bark. I&#039;ll use real branches on my head, shoulders, and elbows, to give some texture. I spent some time thinking about what season I should be, but ultimately decided that since it&#039;s October, I&#039;ll be an autumn tree. Also, the craft store had a bunch of decorative autumn leaves on sale which would work perfectly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could already anticipate some challenges. First, my sketches looked a lot more like some sort of awkward deer-man than a tree, so I will need to be sure to make it not look like antlers. Second, since I&#039;m already very tall (which is why I thought being a tree would be fun), adding a few feet of real branches to my head would make for a very cumbersome individual. I could always just wear brown pants, a brown shirt, a green hat, and green gloves, and call it a day, but that&#039;s just no fun at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I figured a perfectly reasonable place to start would be:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Part 1: The Head</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided that I would first figure out how to attach branches to the top of my head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat01%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI got these little foam half-balls at the craft store. I feel like they would be pretty handy for a lot of different costume ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat02%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nWith my trusty multitool, I got to work hollowing out the bottom a bit, so it would fit on my head a bit better, since I have a generally round-shaped head.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat03%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere is one, somewhat hollowed out. I suppose I could have just jammed the sticks right into my skull, but then again, that&#039;s a terrible idea.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat04%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nElliott wanted to help. Foam balls are actually his favorite thing. Even when fresh, these half-balls left little foam particles everywhere. After wearing this costume, I will have some serious dandruff (or a lot <em>more</em> serious dandruff).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat05%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere are both half-balls, finished. When hollowing out foam half-balls, a knife works much better than a flat-head screwdriver. That&#039;s a real tip that you can use on your own tree costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat06%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nIf the tree thing doesn&#039;t work out, I can always just turn it into some sort of buxom babe costume.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat07%20copy.jpg' height='975' width='650'><br>\r\nElliott helped me pick out which branches I would be using. I found this big branch that had fallen out of a tree, and snapped some smaller branches from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat08%20copy.jpg' height='975' width='650'><br>\r\nElliott agreed that these looked the best of the lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat09%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nOne of the branches had some damage during its life on the street from a squirrel or something, so I patched it up with some hot glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat10%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI cut the end of the branch off so it would have a cleaner base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point the batteries in my camera died, and I have lost the charger for them somewhere, so I had to use Alyson&#039;s camera for the rest of the pictures. I am sorry about the drop in picture quality from here on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat11%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nI got this cheap-o sock cap at K-mart (I guess it&#039;s a 'Kap'). You can&#039;t really tell, but the two foam half-balls are inside it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat12%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nTold you. I had built basically a foam half-ball padded bra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat13%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI cut the branches down a bit, and added a few little twigs and things to make them a bit more interesting. They are ready to be inserted into the Kap here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat14%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nHere is the first branch inserted into the foam half-ball, through the Kap. I was very surprised by how sturdy the sticks were, just jammed into about an inch and a half of foam, but they aren&#039;t terribly heavy, so there you go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat15%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nThe Kap adds about three inches to my skull, and the branches add about three feet. Take that, doorways. Here&#039;s hoping Alyson&#039;s friend doesn&#039;t have any ceiling fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat16%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI was worried about the Kap holding on to my head. I didn&#039;t want to have to hold my neck straight all night, because that would end up being pretty painful. I therefore glued this headband to the inside of the Kap, and it provides a great deal of stability, although it&#039;s a bit harder to put on, now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, so my plan to make the bark would be to take a bunch of paper grocery bags (you can see them in the background of some of these pictures) and crimple them into a sort of faux-bark texture. It&#039;s just like faux-fur, except this is still made out of a tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat17%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nHere I am crimpling my first stretch of paper for the Kap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat18%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nIt actually works pretty great. Since it&#039;s heavy paper, it meant I could just glue it directly to the Kap, instead of using cardboard for structure, as per my original plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat19%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nNow I just had to wrap the Kap up like a . . . sandwich. I couldn&#039;t think of a better 'wrap up' analogy, so sorry about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat21%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThe first little bit is applied here, the tree&#039;s scalp. You can almost make out what movie I&#039;m watching here. If you can guess, I will give you a real prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat22%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nMore paper applied. Does it look like a tree yet? Does it look like a deer-man yet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat23%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI don&#039;t know why I took so many pictures of this process. It was a bit tedious to do, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a bit tedious to watch. I guess I was just trying to make sure it looked like bark. I mean, it does, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat25%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nThe apartment looks really messy in this picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat26%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nHere is Alyson, modeling her Sea Urchin headpiece, which she made out of a foam half-ball and food skewers. I told you those foam half-balls would work for other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat28%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThe top of the Kap is pretty finished here. I wrapped paper around the sticks, to give it a transition from Kap to branch without looking too much like somebody just shoved some sticks into a Kap and called it a day. I don&#039;t like all the seams in the paper, but hopefully when I paint it those will go away some. I also might add some more paper in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat29%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nLook at this cool dude. Such a cool dude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat30%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nI then added a bit around the back of the head, to 'connect' it with the main body of the tree (i.e. my body).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat31%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nI had built a samurai helmet out of paper bags. Perhaps I will be a sort of awkward deer-shogun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat32%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI added some crinkled paper around the face hole, to give it more of the feeling of being an actual hole in the tree. When I saw how neat this looked on my face, I decided that I would paint my face to look like an owl, peering out through this hole in the tree. Maybe I shouldn&#039;t say that, in case I decide not to do it and I end up looking the fool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/hat/hat33%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nAlyson tried on the (mostly) finished tree-Kap. It looks pretty big on her head. I think I will add a bit more paper at the bottom, as per the sketches I made, to fully frame the face and cover up my neck completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&#039;s the first part of the costume, (mostly) done! Stay tuned for the next part of the whole ordeal, and feel free to leave your comments below. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let me know so I can try to incorporate them (before it&#039;s too late!). Also, let me know what you&#039;ll be dressing up as for Halloween.</p>\n\n",

I usually discard the bag-bottoms, because they are too stiff and not very useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_2%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Elliott helped me figure out exactly how big the upper arm piece needed to be, and we cut it like so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_3%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Then I did the krankle process to give it that faux bark feel. Originally I meant to wrap this paper around cardboard, to give it extra structure, but I decided that the paper alone had enough structure, and it would be much more comfortable to wear for a while without the cardboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_4%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Here is the right upper arm piece, glued into a tube shape. Yes, I am watching Deep Space 9 on the TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_5%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>It fit! The beauty of this costume is that there really is no such thing as a mistake. Any irregularities in the construction will only make it look <em>more</em> like a tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_6%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I did the same thing for the forearm. Each arm used pretty much exactly one grocery bag (minus the bag-bottoms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_7%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I added a bit to the forearm, and cut out some paper on the inside of the elbow. It was fun to kind of sculpt the joint so they fit together and so I can still bend my arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_8%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>The outside of the forearm piece juts out a bit, to cover the joint. It really was very much like a suit of armor, but would it look very much like a tree eventually? Here I made a couple marks to connect them together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_9%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I used a rubber band as a strap, hot gluing it to the upper arm piece first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_10%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I will then connect the upper arm piece to the trunk-cuirass, so I won&#039;t have to worry about the arms falling off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_11%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>The rubber band worked perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_12%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>You can see how the pieces fit together here. Hopefully it will look like a big crooked branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_13%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I will need to fasten a separate piece to the inside, to cover the big gap that forms when I extend my arm. I don&#039;t have to worry about the costume wrinkling when I move, because it comes pre-wrinkled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_14%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>This is how it will eventually connect to the trunk-cuirass, with a simple paper pauldron covering my shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/arms/arms_15%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>This makes me want to make an actual suit of armor, but I would probably not be able to do it just with paper bags and hot glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there are the arms (mostly) done. Any guesses what I&#039;ll work on next?</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>Halloween has come and gone, and I still have a great deal of pictures to post of my sweet costume. I will continue to post them, if just for my own benefit next year when I need inspiration for my 'End of the World' costume in 2012 (I just made that up, but it would actually be a sweet costume). Anyway, here is another update on my 2011 Halloween costume.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I went as a tree this year.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Make sure to read parts <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00270'>One</a> and <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/news.php?post=00271'>Two</a> so you know what&#039;s going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Part 3: The Legs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legs are probably the coolest part of the costume. I kind of just want pants that I can wear all the time that look like these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_1%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>As with the arms, the legs started with a couple nice, long strips of paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_2%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Here&#039;s one of the strips, crampled up and rolled into a tubish sort of shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_3%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Then I cut sections out of the tube to make it fit around my groin region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_4%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br> I pulled these handles from one of the bags I used. I figured they would be perfect for strapping my legs to my hips. I would loop my belt through the handles and it would keep my tree-pants from falling down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_5%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Here is the right upper leg piece, with some more paper glued to the top, to make it fully cover my leg up to my waistline. The handle is attached so it will meet my belt right where the top of the paper is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_6%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>It&#039;s not awkward to look down my pants, is it? The handles worked perfectly. They kept the tree-legs up, while still giving me free range of motion in my legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_7%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Here are both upper leg pieces, with belt-handles in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_8%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>They had a real 'paper cowboy' feel to them. Incidentally, these are the very pants I decided to wear with the costume, so I wore them while working on the legs to be sure it would all fit. My Mom made these pants for me, making the costume substantially more home-made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_9%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>The lower leg pieces worked very much like the lower arm pieces. I made crombled tube-shapes and cut around where my arm bends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_10%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I then connected the pieces together with yarn. The lower-leg piece jutted up over my knee, and really made the legs feel like medieval armor. I keep harping on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_11%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>I wanted an asymmetrical look in the legs, so I made the other lower-leg component a bit more cone-shaped than tube-shaped. A tree trunk is more like a bell-bottom than a khaki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_12%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>That&#039;s a picture of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_14%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>I tried them on, and they fit great. There was a bit of a draft in the crotch, though, so I would definitely have to wear pants under them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_15%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Elliott wasn&#039;t a huge fan of the costume so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/legs/legs_16%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>Ice Cream break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Part three: Part two: The Feet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my goals for the Tree Costume was to have super cool roots growing out of my feet. I debated a few different ways of creating them, and settled on newspaper and wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_1%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I went down to the corner and grabbed a handful of Onions. I hoped that they would imbue my costume with some inherent comedy energy. Also, my camera&#039;s batteries were charged back up, so the quality of these pictures will get much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_2%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Elliott checked the legs for defects. It was sort of a cat scan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_3%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I first made a ring out of extra bag-paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_4%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I reinforced it with wire. This way, I could make sure the bottoms of the legs would be exactly what shape I wanted them to be. This would also be a good anchor point for the root-feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_5%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I took a page or two of newspaper and rolled it up into a root-like shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_6%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>With wire stuck inside, I could bend the roots into any shape I wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_7%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Then I made four more of them. I made various shapes and sizes, including a 'Y' shaped one which looked pretty neat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_8%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Then I attached the roots to the paper/wire ring. I made sure to lay them out in an interesting way. I wanted to make sure they would cover up my shoes as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_9%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Here you can see it in place. It&#039;s starting to look pretty great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_10%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I used a lot of glue and duct tape to attach the roots to the bottom of the leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_12%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Now I prepared to wrap each root in paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_13%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>And so I began wrapping each root in paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_14%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Then I continued wrapping each root in paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_15%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>After that, I did more continuing to wrap each root in paper. Sheesh this is boring. I need to make this more interesting</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_16%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Here&#039;s the last root covered in paper, but I did this one IN SPACE! Now it&#039;s more interesting, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_24%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Let me show you the root-making process in a bit more detail. First I start with a length of wire, a bit longer than the root will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_25%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I then started loosely wrapping paper around the wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_27%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Once the root was shaped nicely, I wrapped it with masking tape, to keep it all together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_28%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I kept a bit of wire sticking out of the top, to have a strong anchor point to connect it with the leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_29%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>So here are the roots for the other leg, arranged neatly in a row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_30%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>I placed the roots around my foot to figure out the best layout. I try to keep the longer ones in front, to fully cover my foot. They only go around the outside, so they won&#039;t get all tangled with the other foot when I walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_31%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Here they are connected together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_32%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>Elliott made sure no little creatures (or little stuffed creatures) got in my way as I worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_33%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>More glue and duct tape connected the other rootfoot with the other leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/feet/feet_34%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>And more paper covered the roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, the legs and feet were done. Now I just had to do the torso, and give everything a nice coat of paint (or two).</p>\n\n",

half-deserted streets,\r\n\t<br>The muttering retreats\r\n\t<br>Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\r\n\t<br>And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\r\n\t<br>Streets that follow like a tedious argument\r\n\t<br>Of insidious intent\r\n\t<br>To lead you to an overwhelming question...\r\n\t<br>Oh, do not ask, 'What is it?'\r\n\t<br>Let us go and make our visit.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>In the room the women come and go\r\n\t<br>Talking of Michelangelo.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\r\n\t<br>The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,\r\n\t<br>Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening\r\n\t<br>Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\r\n\t<br>Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\r\n\t<br>Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\r\n\t<br>And seeing that it was a soft October night,\r\n\t<br>Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.\r\n\t<br>And indeed there will be time\r\n\t<br>For the yellow smoke that slides along the street\r\n\t<br>Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;\r\n\t<br>There will be time, there will be time\r\n\t<br>To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\r\n\t<br>There will be time to murder and create,\r\n\t<br>And time for all the works and days of hands\r\n\t<br>That lift and drop a question on your plate,\r\n\t<br>Time for you and time for me,\r\n\t<br>And time yet for a hundred indecisions,\r\n\t<br>And for a hundred visions and revisions,\r\n\t<br>Before the taking of a toast and tea.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>In the room the women come and go\r\n\t<br>Talking of Michelangelo.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>And indeed there will be time\r\n\t<br>To wonder, 'Do I dare?' and, 'Do I dare?'\r\n\t<br>Time to turn back and descend the stair,\r\n\t<br>With a bald spot in the middle of my hair.\r\n\t<br>(They will say: 'How his hair is growing thin!')\r\n\t<br>My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\n\t<br>My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin.\r\n\t<br>(They will say: 'But how his arms and legs are thin!')\r\n\t<br>Do I dare\r\n\t<br>Disturb the universe?\r\n\t<br>In a minute there is time\r\n\t<br>For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>For I have known them all already, known them all.\r\n\t<br>Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\n\t<br>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\n\t<br>I know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\n\t<br>Beneath the music from a farther room.\r\n\t<br>So how should I presume?\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>And I have known the eyes already, known them all.\r\n\t<br>The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\n\t<br>And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\n\t<br>When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\n\t<br>Then how should I begin\r\n\t<br>To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n\t<br>And how should I presume?\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>And I have known the arms already, known them all.\r\n\t<br>Arms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n\t<br>(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\r\n\t<br>Is it perfume from a dress\r\n\t<br>That makes me so digress?\r\n\t<br>Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n\t<br>And should I then presume?\r\n\t<br>And how should I begin?\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\n\t<br>And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\n\t<br>Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>I should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\n\t<br>Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\n\t<br>Smoothed by long fingers,\r\n\t<br>Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,\r\n\t<br>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\n\t<br>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\n\t<br>Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\n\t<br>But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\n\t<br>Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in\r\n\t<br>upon a platter,\r\n\t<br>I am no prophet-and here&#039;s no great matter;\r\n\t<br>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\n\t<br>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\n\t<br>And in short, I was afraid.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\t<br>And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\n\t<br>After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\n\t<br>Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\n\t<br>Would it have been worth while,\r\n\t<br>To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\n\t<br>To have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\n\t<br>To roll it towards some overwhelming question,\r\n\t<br>To say: 'I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\n\t<br>Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all!'\r\n\t<br>If one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n\t<br>Should say: 'That is not what I meant at all.\r\n\t<br>That is not it, at all.'\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<br>And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\n\t<br>Would it have been worth while,\r\n\t<br>After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\n\t<br>After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along\r\n\t<br>the floor.\r\n\t<br>And this, and so much more?\r\n\t<br>It is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\n\t<br>But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\n\t<br>Would it have been worth while\r\n\t<br>If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\n\t<br>And turning toward the window, should say:\r\n\t<br>'That is not it at

      "text": "\n\n<p>From January 9th to the 16th, 2012, this website (DenyConformity.com) was shut down. Though I would love to say that it was because I was engaging in an extended <a href='https://www.google.com/landing/takeaction/'>protest</a> of SOPA, it was actually something far more boring. Since I am making a post today, though, I am bound by the INTERNET CODE to reference how evil SOPA is as much as possible, so I apologize in advance for that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll have to go back a bit (just for a few sentences, I promise), to the early days of this website. Back in the ye olde days of 2005, I was a young, go-getting amateur web designer looking for a place to put a website that I could use to learn how to set up a website. After a tiny bit of searching, I found the cheapest host I could find, otherwise known as &ldquo;Startlogic.com.&rdquo; I set up my site, and everything worked fine. Over the years I had a few troubles here and there, but most were the fault of my lack of experience with the entire process. Startlogic, it seemed, was perfectly adequate for the task of hosting a low-tech website with an audience of several.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/small_startlogic.PNG' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' height='344' width='600'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Incidentally, this is the exact same photograph and layout that they had six years ago. They either have absolutely fantastic employee retention (that chick in front does look pretty faithful, despite having to work with the guy on the right side of the back row), or they&rsquo;re - gasp - liars! Other lies on their page (in addition to the &ldquo;Real People&rdquo;depicted therein) include &ldquo;Real Service,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Savings.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThat was a problem solved, then (well, it wasn&rsquo;t ever really a problem, so I guess it was a problem invented and then also solved). Over the last six (and a half) years, my little website has grown to a . . . well, it&rsquo;s still the same hacked together, obviously made by somebody who didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing mess. However, my little web empire has expanded to include quite a few other little kingdoms. I&rsquo;ve pointed a few other domains at my Startlogic webspace, allowing me to host a couple websites for much cheaper than if I set them up separately. These sites include <a href='http://mynameissmac.com'>mynameissmac.com</a> (the website for my mediocre music producing alter-ego), <a href='http://mcgillandhughes.com'>mcgillandhughes.com</a> (the website for my on again, off again podcast with Will Hughes), and <a href='http://factorydinosaur.com'>factorydinosaur.com</a> (the site for the improv comedy group I am a part of in Chicago). I also set up a few sub-domains for some friends.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIn late 2009, things started going rather pear-shaped with good old Startlogic. It was around that time that I started using a service called &ldquo;Pingdom.&rdquo; Pingdom will automatically poll a web domain every fifteen minutes, and notify you (via various methods; my favorite is Twitter) when the domain is down. I set it up to check on DenyConformity.com, just to see how good Startlogic&rsquo;s uptime was.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis elicits a very quick technical aside. One of the more important aspects of a web host is &ldquo;uptime,&rdquo; or the percentage of time their servers are actively serving content. I would copy the definition from Wikipedia, but it is currently down in protest. Basically, if they have a problem with their servers or they shut them down for maintenance, their uptime goes down (time). Lower uptime means more time that your site won&rsquo;t be visible, which is the opposite of what you want your website to be. It&rsquo;s totally a buzzword, though, like &ldquo;HD,&rdquo; &ldquo;Organic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Democratic.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no regulatory committee keeping track of uptime, and there&rsquo;s no burden of proof for anybody who claims &ldquo;99.99%.&rdquo; Therefore, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to just fudge the numbers a bit, and most web hosting providers do, in fact, claim 99.99%. Of course, uptime won&rsquo;t mean anything anymore if SOPA goes through, so you should go call your Senator right now.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAccording to WebHostingStuff.com (which isn&rsquo;t blacked out in protest right now), Startlogic&rsquo;s uptime is 99.99%, which is great. That means in the last 2,319 days (which is how long this WebHostingStuff place has been tracking it), Startlogic has only been down 0.01%. Let&rsquo;s look at the numbers. 2,319 days is 200,361,600 seconds, and 0.01% of that is 20,036 seconds, or about five and a half hours.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nYeah, but who the crap is WebHostingStuff.com, anyway? They aren&#039;t protesting SOPA and so they are evil corporate weiners who are probably in the pocket of Big Webhost. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve been using my own tracking service for the last three years. In that time, Pingdom has recorded an uptime of only 99.68%. Since October, 2009, DenyConformity.com has been down a total of two days, fourteen hours, fifty-nine minutes and fourty-six seconds!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/pingdom%20report.PNG' style='width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto' height='554' width='639'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>It is <strong>very</strong> important I include this graph.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIf you know anything about stats and math, you&rsquo;ll know that the more numbers you include in your mean average, the closer that mean will approach 100%. A site could be down quite a bit, but if you look at it over six years it will average out to be closer to that 99.99% that everybody claims. Also, if you know anything about the web, you might realize that downtime is a necessary part of how things work, and if a site is down a few hours a month it&rsquo;s not really a problem if it&rsquo;s always at 5 AM, when nobody will be trying to look at it, anyway. I could try to paint Startlogic as a bad company (though they are also not protesting today) just because they have some downtime, but in truth it&rsquo;s nothing to be concerned about.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSo anyway, it was then, when I started using Pingdom, that I really started thinking that I should look for a new place to hang my @. I was getting almost daily reports of outages at all times of day, and any time I tried to contact Startlogic to figure out just want their deal was, it was like talking to a brick wall. A brick wall that charges you a bunch of money. My biggest push in this regard was to set up my own server to host my site, and thereby avoid dealing with bad third parties entirely. I wrote a <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00247'>couple</a> <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/content/olds.php?post=00252'>posts</a> about those efforts back in April, 2010. I still plan on continuing that tale for you, my only audience member, and it is the subject of a different post than this. However, the short story is that the Official DenyConformity.com Web Server is simply not yet (and will likely never be) quite ready for full-time hosting duties. However, it was, among other things, a distraction from the task at hand, namely G&rsquo;ing the F O from Startlogic and their oppressive boot of ineptitude.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/startlogic_closeup.png' style='width: 185px; display: block; margin: auto' height='140' width='185'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>She&#039;s just so happy to do nothing for you.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nPresented for your perusal, anecdote number one from the history of DenyConformity.com&rsquo;s many outages. The two most basic parts of a website are the Domain and the Server, and though you can buy them (though you&rsquo;re really just renting them) both together, they are basically separate entities. If you aren&rsquo;t quick enough on the draw and your domain&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t set to auto-renew, after a year or two passes they won&rsquo;t be yours anymore. Who owns them at that point depends on a lot of strange, theoretical conditions, but the world of domains is still very much the Wild, Wild West. Instead of banditos taking over your ranch, it&rsquo;s GoDaddy.com <a href='http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/cybersquatting-what-what-can-be-29778.html'>squatting</a> on your domain, charging you ridiculous (and illegal) amounts of money to get it back. Instead of revolvers, it&rsquo;s DNS caches, and instead of Will Smith, it&rsquo;s Danika Patrick in extremely misleading ads.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/danica.jpg' style='width: 418px; display: block; margin: auto' height='355' width='418'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Literally nothing else happens. Godaddy.com fails to deliver even what the Internet was designed for: porn.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAnyway, this happened to me around September, 2010. I registered DenyConformity.com in August, 2005, and renewed it perfectly well over the next five years. Apparently, though, I forgot, and in 2010 it expired and was eventually sat (or shat) upon by a cyber squatting fiend. Luckily, DenyConformity.com is a lonely person&rsquo;s seldom visited, angst-filled blog worth almost exactly nothing, so it was somewhat easy to just register it again and point it back at my site. It did mean that for a few days all you got when you went to DenyConformity.com was this garbage:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/small_squatter_1.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' height='490' width='600'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>You tried to visit DenyConformity.com. You probably meant Conformity.com.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nParticularly amusing is just how these completely automated sites dealt with what they thought DenyConformity.com was for. Apparently the primary categories for my site, according to robots, is &ldquo;Conformity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Deny,&rdquo; &ldquo;Real Estate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Apartment for Rent.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad that for those few days anybody who wanted to see DenyConformity.com immediately got a link for &ldquo;Conformity.&rdquo; I guess I should be glad they weren&rsquo;t making judgements about my life. Well,</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/small_squatter_2.jpg' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' height='561' width='600'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>If you&#039;re looking for Shauvon McGill, perhaps you would enjoy these other cartoon characters.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAccording to this robot, I seriously need some psychotherapy, and am also, apparently, a cartoon. That was somewhat disconcerting.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSo I lost my domain for a few days and then got it back. Big deal? Well, the question is, how exactly could this have happened? It absolutely shouldn&rsquo;t have is the answer. The fact is that Startlogic made absolutely no attempts to contact the account owner that their domains were expiring. Sure, the domains were still registered on my Purdue email address, and this was a year after I graduated, but my hosting account was definitely updated properly. They were perfectly content to let me continue to pay them for hosting access, even though my primary domain name, at the time the only way to access that web space, no longer existed. That&rsquo;s a pretty great business model, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThat should have been my sign that the time to G the F was finally N. I pushed forward with my server at home and settled on a complacent, &ldquo;eh, who cares?&rdquo; Eventually, Startlogic dropped the final straw bomb that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/site_suspended.PNG' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' height='366' width='784'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>At least it wasn&#039;t expelled, right?</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIt perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t have been so annoying if Startlogic hadn&rsquo;t picked the absolute worst time to drop this bomb. I just started a full-time job, so my free time immediately went from tons to nones. The very first day on this new job I received an email from Startlogic, saying the following: </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>denyconf / Cgi abuse [9156098]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hello ,</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis is to inform you that your website and CGI have been suspended.

Needless to say I did have further questions. I contacted them that evening, mainly to ask fuck, and what about it. I tried to get them to clarify exactly what they meant, or when or how these heavy resources were being used. However, nobody gave me any info outside what was stated in Dylan&rsquo;s email. Let me be clear: this site hasn&rsquo;t changed in six years. That file, /content/olds.php is the same olds.php which has lived right there in /content/ for as long as this site has existed. That&rsquo;s what I needed clarification on. Just what, exactly, has changed? They had no answer for me.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI understand that they have little room for customers using &ldquo;heavy network/server resources,&rdquo; but this time enough was enough. At this point I had no intention of fixing whatever &ldquo;problem&rdquo; suddenly appeared for no reason after six years. They made no effort to either warn me of the problem or work with me to fix it. Perhaps I&rsquo;m being naive, but I feel like that&rsquo;s not how a company should treat a (until this point) loyal customer of over half a decade. I had no interest in &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; my application.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/dc_down/small_bluehost.PNG' style='width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto' height='374' width='600'></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Why hello, there, Bluehost lady.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAfter an evening or two analyzing my options, I decided to move my business to Bluehost (.com). I&rsquo;ve worked with Bluehost in the past with no complaints, was referred there by a colleague or two, and had a reasonably positive exchange with one of their support team. Also, hey, they have a big &ldquo;Stop SOPA&rdquo; banner on their site today. After finding the host, it took another evening to go through the process of transferring all of my domain names (a process that is far too complicated). Then, frustratingly, I had to sit and wait five more days for the domain transfers to be processed (for which I blame Startlogic). Finally, though, the site is back up and running (as made clear by the fact that you&rsquo;re reading it now). All that&rsquo;s left to do is somehow get Startlogic to give me as much refund as I can get out of them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSo, basically, if you need a summary of this post, because I can&rsquo;t keep from writing page after page on the simplest of subjects, it is this: my website was down, for a reason I don&rsquo;t know, and it took a week to get running again. Also down with SOPA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe real sad thing is that I was planning on posting the rest of my Halloween costume pictures last week . . .</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>I have not forgotten about these pictures! Did you? Remember my Halloween costume from 2011, when I was going as a Tree? No? Remember, I made the whole thing out of paper grocery bags? This really isn&#039;t ringing any bells? Well, I don&#039;t blame you, it&#039;s been like four months since Halloween, and I&#039;m sure nobody cares about that grand old time anymore. Now that we&#039;re huddled in our houses trying not to either freeze to death or drown, depending on what crazy weather Chicago is throwing at us, let&#039;s kill time by just thinking back to when we were still thinking about the Halloween episode of the Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so let&#039;s get down to business, with the torso component of my costume. Better look up the Wikipedia page for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuirass'>Cuirass</a> now, because I&#039;m going to be using it a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_1%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThis is a picture of more paper bags. Hooray!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_2%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThe torso would need a much larger piece, though, so I had to glue two pieces together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_3%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nBam!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_5%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI used a T-shirt (or teeshirt?) as a template. Soon I would have my own custom-made paper t-shirt (teashirt?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_6%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI loosely traced the shape, and cut it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_8%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThe back was slightly different than the front. It had a different collar and arm holes. They were both instantiated from the same tshirt (t . . . shirt?) pattern, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_10%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nThen I did a good old crinkle-crankle-up on them both to give them my patent-pending faux-bark (foe bark?) texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_12%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI glued the two pieces together just like a real t-shirt (tishirt?). One whole side (the right side in this picture) was un-connected from arpit to waist, to allow me to actually put the thing on. Paper is not nearly as flexible as shirt fabric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_13%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nWhich was quickly made apparent when I tried it on and it ripped in several places. I didn&#039;t want to be some sort of weird Tree / the Hulk costume, so I decided to reinforce the torso&#039;s various orifices (I&#039;m sorry about this sentence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_16%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nSome rolled / crumpled up paper glued to the neck hole and the two arm holes stemmed the tears. Ooh, I mean dried up my tears. Yes, that&#039;s a much better joke on the word 'tears.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_18%20copy.jpg' height='867' width='650'><br>\r\nHere it is on my body! The look on my face is due to the concentration it took to take this picture without using my hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_19%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nBut yes, it was sort of more of a paper apron (papron!) at this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_21%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nAnyway, I asynchronously worked on the shoulder structure. I have now used programming terms more than the promised 'cuirass.' Sorry about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_22%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nOk, so here&#039;s the idea. I built a framework out of folded-up bag bottoms (they are much more sturdy than the regular parts of bags). The two branches I decided on for the shoulders were well glued to the center piece. My idea was that this would allow the flexibility to move with my body, while still being sturdy enough to keep the branches from having erectile dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_24%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nBut oh yeah, how would I be able to put it on with everything else? I sawed the branches off, so they wouldn&#039;t get in the way of working on the thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_25%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nHere we have the structure finished. the hexagon shape would go around my head, and the branch-connector would go behind my neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_27%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nI lined it up inside the papron, to make sure all of my measurement were correct. That&#039;s not a typo, the only thing I measured was the gap between my shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_28%20copy.jpg' height='488' width='650'><br>\r\nSome slits in the shoulders would let the branches stick out through the papron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_29%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nThen I devised a brilliant scheme to connect the shoulder branches on the spot, after the neck truss and papron were donned. I&#039;m really knocking the crazy word count out of the park on this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_32%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere&#039;s the big idea. The shorter PVC pipe would be attached to the branch end sticking out of the truss, with the elbow permanently attached to that. The longer PVC part would be attached to the branch. Just with friction, the PVC pipe jammed into the elbow would hopefully be enough to hold the branch up, while still allowing the convenience of quick ass-/dissembly. Woah, I probably shouldn&#039;t use that term anymore, because it makes it seem like I want to dissemble my ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_34%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nThis process involved lots of glue. Ignore the wire sticking out of the end, though. I thought having a wire in the middle would add to the stability of it, but that was pretty dumb. It only made it more awkward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_39%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nFor added strength, I drilled a hole in the connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_40%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nAnd jammed a skewer in it, sawing off the excess. That puppy was pretty secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_41%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nGratuitous. Seriously, though, the cutest cat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_44%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere I am taking a look at the connection. Again, the wire was just getting in the way. Just imagine it isn&#039;t there, and that I&#039;m great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_46%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere I am trying it on. The placement was pretty perfect, and the shoulder truss structure actually seemed pretty good, for a thing made out of paper and glue. Also, we have Facebook on the TV (TEEvee?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='../assets/images/costume/torso/torso_47%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere&#039;s a closeup of how it sticks out of the papron. This allowed me to put the costume on pretty easily, by putting on the shoulder truss, then the papron - sticking the PVC elbows through the shoulders - and finally sticking the branches on. This method of donning made things much easier. Well, everything was easier except for the grammar needed to describe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I have to get to bed. That&#039;s all for part 4. Hopefully I can get the rest posted without too many more parts! Thanks for sticking it out with me on this saga which will probably end up taking us to Halloween, 2012.</p>\n\n",

I hoped that the various layers of paper would make it obvious that it was just paper. Theoretically, though, paper is made out of trees, so it&#039;s all the same anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_51%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI could still yank the branch piece out of the socket, so the plan was still good to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_54%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI got rid of the wire, because I had determined that it was a terrible idea. To attach the branch, I had to maneuver it into the shoulder cone, get that stupid wire to stick in the tiny hole in the branch, and then get the PVC piece to fit into the elbow. It was a difficult thing to do, especially when wearing a full-on papron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_55%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nThe other side was much smaller than the PVC piece, so I had to add some material to make it fit better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_56%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nSo I wrapped some duct tape around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_58%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nAnd with some glue the PVC pipe fit much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_59%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere&#039;s the finished shoulder truss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_65%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nHere&#039;s the papron with the other shoulder cone in place. You can also see the detail I added to the collar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_68%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nNow I had to get to work on the pauldrons. The suit of armor made of grocery bags would soon be fully realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_69%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nThat was actually pretty easy. One quick piece of paper, and a little detail work was all it took.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_71%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI attached a couple more pieces to fully cover the shoulder joint. I did not want to be a tree with big old armpits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_72%20copy.jpg' height='975' width='650'><br>\r\nThat night, a friend of Alyson&#039;s stopped by and they wanted to see what the costume looked like so far. This was the first time I wore it all at once, so it was a good test to see how it all fit. It actually worked pretty well. I took a quick note of where the costume needed some more detail work (the beauty of a costume made of paper is that you can just jot notes down right there on your body).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_74%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nThe next day I dug out the velcro sticky backs (which I had purchased for this very purpose), and got to work making it not a papron anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_75%20copy.jpg' height='433' width='650'><br>\r\nI stuck them right on, using three along the entire length of the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/torso/torso_77%20copy.jpg' height='975' width='650'><br>\r\nThey worked perfectly.

      "text": "\n\n<p>I&#039;m always fascinated by technology and engineering. If it has gears, springs, mechanisms, or otherwise intricate little bits, it stands out, to me, as an artifact of human ingenuity. What is most fascinating, some times, about these seldom thought about tools is just how seldom we think about them. How often do you question the mechanism inside your bedside clock? How often do you contemplate the workings of your furnace, or your electric mixer? You shouldn&#039;t spend time thinking about these things, normally, because that&#039;s exactly what they&#039;re for. Tools, whether as complex as a mechanical clock, or as simple as an upside-down cup for trapping horrifying bugs, exist specifically to allow you to go about your lives with less to think about (or be terrified by, in the case of the bug-trapper). You shouldn&#039;t have to worry about whether your clock is accurate. I like to stop, some times, and appreciate just how much hard work and thought has gone into giving me that luxury. There is a certain strange irony in that; a great deal of thought and, certainly, a fair share of sleepless nights went into creating things just to allow others to think and worry less (or sleep just five minutes more). I guess most of these engineers and thinkers just do it for the fame and fortune, but still, even if the function is a side-effect, it seems worthwhile to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s just a long, nerdy way for me to justify and mitigate the inherent nerd-ness of beginning a pedantic exploration of one such tool, writing utensils. I am really sounding like a dork, now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve always been interested in pens (and pencils). They&#039;re kind of a great equalizer. Even the President uses a pen, when he&#039;s signing his autographs or whatever he does. I know it&#039;s a little strange for somebody who is as obsessed with electronic gizmos as I am to be interested in something blatantly ye-olde-school, but like I said, they&#039;re quite interesting as engineering marvels. I have decided to share my interest with you, my faithful audience. I shall begin collecting pens, using them, and letting you know just how they compare to one another. Does it matter what pen you use, or are they just simple tools that give us yet another thing we don&#039;t have to think about? I seek to find out, and I&#039;ll keep you updated along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should know, of course, that I am no expert in the field of writing utensils. I am so much a layman, in fact, that I don&#039;t even know what the field is called. However, I&#039;m not sure what qualifications are needed, if any, to review pens, so I&#039;ll just have to do my best. If nothing else, I&#039;m a normal person who doesn&#039;t mind spending moderate amounts of money to buy as many pens as he can in a quest for the best. Also, I might sometimes make rhymes, so watch out for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, some questions come up. What questions should I be asking when trying out a new pen? What are important features to consider, or benchmarks I can use to gauge quality? These are, after all, just pens, so perhaps I&#039;m already over thinking this. I shall do my best to answer the most important considerations I can think of, namely the following: <strong>comfort</strong>, <strong>ink</strong> and <strong>construction quality</strong>, <strong>ease of use</strong>, and <strong>price</strong>. Perhaps over time I shall develop a set of rigorous tests I can use to quantify these qualities, or perhaps I will be able to develop a loose standard to compare them to, or maybe I&#039;ll just make up some numbers. Whatever the case, I think it will be an interesting diversion, if nothing else. What qualities or tests do you think I should apply?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are there any pens you&#039;ve used which really stick out as good or bad? Have you seen pens which you want to know more about? Let me know, and I&#039;ll check them out for you. Maybe I can save you from having to spend upwards of several dollars getting a bad pen. Nothing is worse than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be asking, Aren&#039;t there other websites which review pens? Aren&#039;t pens just basic implements that everybody uses and which can easily be gotten for free (with sweet company slogans printed on them, too)? Aren&#039;t reviews in general completely useless because they&#039;re based entirely on opinion, which - especially in my case - can vary radically? Who are you, Comrade Question? Maybe you don&#039;t have to read these things if you&#039;re just going to be so negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just want to have some fun, play around with some neat little gadgets, and learn a thing or two. If you stay tuned right here then just maybe you might learn a thing or two, too.</p>\n\n",

      "title": "District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone",
      "text": "\n\n<p>Apparently the thing to do these days is write a catchy pseudo-sci-fi dystopian future novel and then have that novel adapted into a movie. I&rsquo;ve therefore started working on a new novel, which is entitled <em>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</em>. It&rsquo;s about a young woman, named Kate, who gets swept away from her simple life on the robot farm to a grand adventure in a district where they control everything up to how much soda you can drink. Also there&rsquo;s a hot guy named Matt in there. Anyway, here&rsquo;s an excerpt from early in the book, where Kate and Matt are running to a safehouse where they can get some forged documents to help them escape District Alpha. Remember, this is a work in progress - some of the product placement and character descriptions might change as I get a better understanding of what would be best or most profitable in a movie. Also remember that the movie rights are still up for grabs!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><em>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excerpt from Chapter 5</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>. . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class='firstChar'>Kate and Matt were running through the streets of District Alpha, conspicuous among the Government Mandated zombies shuffling through the street. The Peacecorps airship, which could also just be a car or tank if an airship cost too much to do, scanned the alleyways with its searchlights for any sign of Mandate Runners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked over at Matt, a single bead of sweat running down her perfectly curved forehead. She marveled at his ability to keep his hair really well styled in exactly the fashion of the early to mid 21st century, about as much time after this book comes out as it takes to make a movie. <em>How does Matt know so much about the past</em>? Kate thought. He insisted once that he collected books and movies from the period, and that if his great-grandparents hadn&rsquo;t bought as many books and movies as they could - several copies of each, in fact - he never would have been able to survive. If it wasn&rsquo;t for heroes like Matt&rsquo;s great grandparents, the Government Mandate might have completely wiped out society as his great grandparents knew it. Matt was always grateful for his ancestors buying as much as they could all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ducking into an alley, the two of them crouched behind a dumpster, because even in the future they still have garbage. The irony - if there was any, I don&rsquo;t really have time to check - was lost on them, so consumed were they by their fear of the Peacecorps Airship (or car, as the case may be).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly their fears ran straight into cold reality like someone realizing that a mirror was actually a doorway with their long lost twin standing in it. A really, seriously bright searchlight swept the alleyway, and Kate could hear a technotronic voice call out from behind the glaring flash.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, somebody get that ironic dumpster out of the way!&rdquo; The robotical voice proclaimed. It was a Peacecorps Officer, speaking through his standard issue voice modulating, robotic face mask. Matt had heard rumors that the officers didn&rsquo;t even control the voice which was emitted from their own masks, but it was actually a voice transmitted from the great Peacecorps Central Control Bureau, far away in District Omega. Matt whispered that thing to Kate, in fact, because this is important exposition that anybody would need to hear. Kate was not wondering if it was true, though, as another officer casually walked to the dumpster and began moving it out of the way. Kate was far too scared with fear to be concerned with rumors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; the Officer said to the two main characters huddled behind the now moved-out-of-the-way dumpster. The officer&rsquo;s menacing robot-like helmet made him look a lot like a robot. This allows Peacecorps officers to be killed en mass without necessitating an R rating.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even though they were supposed to be crouched in garbage after having run for maybe miles, Kate and Matt still looked really good, like two high-profile movie stars. They were both acting scared, but not acting so much that they would have necessarily been up for an Oscar or anything. They were just regular, normal budget type scared.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, lookie here, Officer Traldo,&rdquo; said the lead Officer, hopping down from the airship / car. He was recognizable because he wasn&rsquo;t wearing a mask like the others. He had the grizzled appearance of a guy who has been cast in a lot of movies as a bad guy, and as she looked up at him Kate got the feeling that this instance was no different. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A couple &lsquo;a&rsquo; Mandate Runners I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; the Peacecorps Leader said. He spoke with a thick accent, to be determined later. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Leader had the same imposing armor that the other Officers had, except he didn&rsquo;t have a helmet as previously mentioned. The standard issue Peacecorps Officer armor had big plates of futuristic techno metal on important areas - Kate thought it looked like the robot feeding troughs they used to use on the robot farm she grew up on. Each Officer had a neat utility belt with all kinds of things that don&rsquo;t really need to be described in detail, except for a gun which is holstered at their hip. The Leader had an additional feature on his left Forearm, a fancy computer interface, which he could use to do all sorts of computer tasks wherever he was. In all, the Leader of the Peacecorps patrol looked really, really cool. Kate thought to herself as he slowly walked toward them that he would be an excellent costume for somebody to go as for Halloween or to a comic convention or something, if only times weren&rsquo;t so dark and dystopian.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The officer who moved the dumpster out of the way - who was apparently called Officer Traldo - looked over at the leader, who was standing in front of a billboard for the Nissan Leaf, a really great car that they still sell in the future because of how great it is. Traldo&rsquo;s robobotnic voice crackled out an affirmative.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Better have yer shootahs primed to lightnings, mates,&rdquo; the Leader said. The other Officers flipped some switches on their really high tech looking guns, and held them ready in their hands. With a high-pitched whine, each pistol foreshadowed its dangerousness to Kate as she crouched behind Matt in fear. She did not know, as Matt did, that the pistols were high-power peace enforcement techno blasters, able to be switched from shooting geometric laser energy to high-voltage incapacification lightning, at the will of the officer carrying it. In lightning mode, anybody shot by the thing would collapse to the ground in pain and then be dead. Even Matt, with his good looks and knowledge of early 21st-century culture would not be immune to the lightnings&rsquo; literal power.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Matt slowly stood, his hands raised in a clear sign of non-hostility. He wanted to speak to the officers, but he was a very courteous young man and knew that young adults should wait to be addressed by the older, wiser, officers before he could talk back. <em>What a courteous young man</em>, thought Kate. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So, thinkin&rsquo; you could run your way out &lsquo;a&rsquo; District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone without any official permits, aye?&rdquo; the Leader eyed Matt up and down, giving him the business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; responded Matt, with clear respectfulness and acquiescence in his voice. Reassured by his calm and courteous demeanor, Kate slowly rose to stand next to him in defiance of these Officers. &ldquo;We were just looking for a little privacy,&rdquo; Matt added.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Leader eyed Matt with a stern eye. Then he eyed over at Kate with the same eye, still just as stern. Kate still had a look of fear on her face, because she was still afraid. The Leader didn&rsquo;t think it was a look of fear, but actually embarrassment, you see. He then came to a conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see what&rsquo;s -a- goin&rsquo; on heah,&rdquo; the Leader said with a grin. He elbowed the Officer next to him, sliding his high tech pistol back into his really cool looking hip holster. &ldquo;we better be leavink these love birds alone, Traldo!&rdquo; At that, the other Officers holstered their pistols, some of them even chuckling to themselves, which Kate could tell because their shoulders were moving up and down rhythmically.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Officer Traldo looked at the Leader with an important thing to say. Then he said it, by saying - in his crackled roboticon voice, &ldquo;sir! Protocol indicates that we scan these civilians for Mandate Conformation.&rdquo; Officer Traldo emphasized his pronunciation of &ldquo;conformation&rdquo; because you can tell it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s written out like this, but if it were actually spoken it would be much harder to tell the difference. They use that word because it&rsquo;s futuristic and cool sounding.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ack, so we should!&rdquo; The Leader stepped forward and flipped a technoswitch on his wrist computer input panel. A large beam of orange or blue - whichever would read better on a movie screen - light swept over both Kate and Matt. Then, a readout appeared like a hologram - because it was a hologram - in front of the Leader&rsquo;s face. The effect of the hologram-like hologram was really quite special, and Kate had never seen a special effect quite like it, growing up on a robot farm as she did.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Matt also thought the effect was special, but he had seen it before so it wasn&rsquo;t quite as impressive to him. He stood there, staring into the special effect. His face, which looked just like either Ryan Gosling or Robert Pattinson, looked very determined and chiseled. He knew what the readout was saying to the Peacecorps Leader.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&lsquo;says &lsquo;ere that you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;et your quota of soff&lsquo;rink for this month, you,&rdquo; the Leader said, looking past the hologram at Matt. &ldquo;You better not be thinkin&rsquo; about enjoying any more delicious, refreshing Coke if you don&rsquo;t want to see my pretty mug again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Kate took note that the Leader used the term &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; to refer to the delicious Coke-a-Cola that she had only recently become acquainted with. She remembered that &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; was exactly what she had done when she first tasted it. She knew that one of Matt&rsquo;s big character things was that he really enjoyed a good Coke, despite whatever the Government Mandate Zone specified their quota was per month in this terrible District they were stuck in - District Alpha.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; the Leader laughed at them. Through a combination of being the future and because he&rsquo;s obviously not a very kind hearted character, the Leader thought what he said about his mug was really funny. His laughs echoed off the alley, which, remember, had a billboard for the Nissan Leaf on it - a really great car of the future. The Officers all climbed back into the airship / car and flew / sped off. If it was an airship, the anti-gravity propulsion system kicked up a bunch of dust and stuff, almost like it&rsquo;s spitting at the two of them in a big insult. I guess a car could do the same thing. Off the Officers went, shining their bright spotlights into the other alleyways ahead of them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Kate turned to Matt, confusion replacing the fear that was painted all over her face in the medium of wrinkles and face muscles instead of oil or water colors. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;I thought we had it for sure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Matt looked down at her. She was cute, like Zoey Deschanel, even though she probably wouldn&rsquo;t take a role like this one. Matt was still realizing just how innocent Kate was, having grown up on a robot farm in District Epsilon. Did she really not understand what the Officers thought they were doing? Neither of them, of course, would have dreamed of doing any private type things for real just yet, even though they were both extremely beautiful and in their early- to mid-twenties, which is the most sexually attractive age, according to focus groups.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She looked up at him, patiently awaiting his answer. He looked at her features, which were really well defined and for a moment thought about how great they would have looked on a big movie screen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally he responded to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later, Kate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re almost to my old friend&rsquo;s apartment, so let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They left the alley, running the last few blocks to Matt&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s place. He hoped that she wouldn&rsquo;t be put off by his friend&rsquo;s awkward appearance, because he looked just like Steve Buscemi. He knew he would just have to deal with that as it happened, just like he had dealt with the Peacecorps Officers, when that happened a little while ago. He could deal with anything, except for the feelings he was now starting to have about this really pretty girl who - he didn&rsquo;t know this yet - would probably be sleeping with him later in the story.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Off they went, on their way to the next adventure as they tried to escape <em>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</em>.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "<p>Welcome to the all new, all awesome DenyConformity.com. What you see here is the culmination of over a year of obsessive, hard work. I know content has been a bit lax over the last year, but now I can finally show what I&rsquo;ve been working on all this time. Welcome to the future. Welcome to DenyConformity.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won&rsquo;t go into depth here about the actual concepts I put to work in the design of the new site. I will continue my design journal entries for anyone out there who is wondering just what I was thinking (I know many of you probably don&rsquo;t feel subject to change, and are therefore a bit lost on this new site). This post, instead, will be a sort of &ldquo;readme&rdquo; document for the site. I will update below with news about new features, additions, and tweaks to the site. Please also consider this post the sounding board for you to let me know what you think of the new layout, and if you have any ideas for ways to make it better. Just find your way to the bottom of the page and hit me up with a comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So without further adieu, I give you:</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>BETA 0.1.1 - &ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo;</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/agamemnon_screenshot.jpg' height='718' width='1000'><div class='caption'>The site as it appeared in its original beta version. Yes, you are all my beta testers.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial build of the new DenyConformity.com was released to the public on April 1st, 2012 (happy April Fool&rsquo;s day!). This version of DenyConformity.com is still very much a beta release, meaning that it is not guaranteed to work perfectly across the board. The site has been tested and works properly in all modern browsers - Firefox 10+, Chrome 17+, Internet Explorer 10, Safari (probably), Android 2.2+, iOS whatever (I&rsquo;m assuming), and oh, let&rsquo;s just say Opera (who&rsquo;s going to verify that?). The site works best at this point in Chrome or Firefox, and is designed to work at pretty much any resolution between 320 and 5000 pixels wide. Check the site out on an Android or iOS device, it&rsquo;s pretty cool. However, I am very worried about how this site will work on my parents&rsquo; extremely old, un-updated version of Firefox. If you find any bugs or you see something that seems wrong, please let me know via an email to beta[at]denyconformity.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; contains all the core functionality of the DenyConformity.com website. The main page, arranged to represent a &ldquo;timeline,&rdquo; shows a small summary of each post (split into pages of thirty posts each). Clicking on a post will take you to the post itself, using a dynamic AJAX-driven interface. The primary design imperative of the new DenyConformity.com is that all user experience takes place on a single page, and - except for extreme situations - no content will require a new page to load. Each post&rsquo;s comments are displayed below the post, and a user can easily post new comments, still without ever leaving the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; ushers in a radical paradigm shift for DenyConformity.com, in a number of ways. First, I am and will be making a conscious effort to produce and gather regular original content. The primary goal of DenyConformity.com has and will always be to be interesting to as many readers as possible. I want the new DenyConformity.com to simply be a really interesting place to visit, and I will be working hard to meet that goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the site now features ads on both the main page and next to each post. Though it might seem that DenyConformity.com has &ldquo;sold out&rdquo; or &ldquo;gone commercial&rdquo; or &ldquo;whatever, Cracked is funnier, anyway,&rdquo; the purpose of the ads - as it is on any website - is to allow me to hopefully get a tiny bit of compensation for the vast amount of work I have spent putting the site together. The goal, initially, is to cover the marginal cost for hosting the site. I am not allowed to tell users to click the ads, thereby increasing my potential revenue, because that&rsquo;s against the terms of Google Adsense. I won&rsquo;t tell you to feel free to click on as many ads as possible on my site. You&rsquo;ll just have to use your own discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This day marks a new era for DenyConformity.com (and, frankly my life in general). Continue to check back regularly as the site continues to evolve and grow into this new role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a long list of features and modifications that I will be making over the next few months, so this is absolutely just the beginning. After six years, this fresh start will be the beginning of something truly great. I hope you will be patient with me as I work out the bugs, tweak things, and slowly (but surely) get all of the functionality set up that I have planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, why not take a moment to follow Deny_Conformity on Twitter, or like my official page on The Facebook? I will share news and updates about the site as it progresses. Also, if you would share the site with your friends (or even enemies), I would definitely appreciate the traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE - 4/5/2012</strong></p>\r\n<h5>BETA 0.2 - &ldquo;Bradbury&rdquo;</h5>\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/bradbury_shot.jpg' height='133' width='449'><div class='caption'>The updated timeline badges.</div>\r\n<p>'Bradbury' addresses several bugs and problems with the initial release. New features / tweaks include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ads now cast square shadows. Also, ads will have black backgrounds, so the space won&#039;t be invisible anymore. Please disable your ad blockers on my site, as I really need the ad revenue.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Twitter box on the main page now casts a shadow.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>There was a bug on the post page which caused the back button to not work. Hitting 'back' would only unload the ad frame, and not actually take the page back. This has been fixed.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The 'go to comments' button on the post page - the last button in the upper-left corner of the post - works properly, now.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Navigating to http://www.denyconformity.com/post/[id]/comments will now take you directly to the comments.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The timeline (the main page) now supports generic news items, which might link any old place. You might have used one of those to get to this very spot!</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You can no longer hotlink any image on my site (you can&#039;t post an image from my site on another site). It is also harder to save images from my site to your computer, because I don&#039;t want you to steal my pictures. If you want a copy of one of my photographs, I would be happy to help you out, but please do not steal my work.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The new site now has a functional RSS feed. You can see the feed (or add it to Google Reader or something) by using the url http://www.denyconformity.com/rss.xml</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I have made a few visual tweaks, including the main page 'new post' and 'news' banners, and the comment boxes on the post page.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I removed a few console debug messages and alerts contained within catastrophic errors. This will not fix the bug heretofore known as the 'Delbert Wilkins Bug' but it should at least clear up some of the symptoms.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE - 4/5/2012</strong></p>\r\n<h5>BETA 0.3 - &ldquo;Crazy Horse&rdquo;</h5>\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/new_ad.JPG' height='292' width='1016'><div class='caption'>One of the all new post-Google ads.</div>\r\n<p>'Crazy Horse' added three great new features to the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, all posts that contain images have a cool new image gallery. Just click on any of the images in the post to see them all in an easy to navigate enlarged view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that, most of the images on the site can now be ordered as a high-quality print. If you find picture you like, check the lower-right hand corner of the image (when you put the mouse on it). Click on 'order print' and you&#039;ll be on your way to your own piece of DenyConformity.com - as well as a really sweet piece of art to hang on your wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I have implemented the first of the new in-house ads. Please let me know if you would like to get your own ad here. Email beta@denyconformity.com for details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE - 4/25/2012</strong></p>\r\n<h5>BETA 0.3.5</h5>\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/broken_shadows.JPG' height='646' width='955'><div class='caption'>This is an example of how the timeline was broken. I (hopefully) fixed this for version 0.3.5.</div>\r\n<p>I&#039;ve just made some tweaks and fixes, so this one isn&#039;t major. The main things are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Images won&#039;t break the timeline or post page (hopefully) when they load, now.</li>\r\n<li>The post controls are tweaked, so the button that takes you back to the timeline looks like a little house, now. I hope that&#039;s a bit easier to understand than an arrow pointing up.</li>\r\n<li>When you link directly to a post, the post title and description are loaded as page metadata. This will make it much easier to share posts on Facebook and whatever.</li>\r\n<li>A bug was causing captions to not show up in galleries. I fixed it.</li>\r\n<li>You can now navigate galleries with the arrow keys. Left and right switches images, up and down shows and hides the caption, and escape closes the gallery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE - 5/23/2012</strong></p>\r\n<h5>BETA 0.4 - 'Defiant'</h5>\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/tags_page.png' height='889' width='1106'><div class='caption'>The new tags page.</div>\r\n<p>Version 0.4 - 'Defiant' adds a great new feature to the site. For a while I&#039;ve been categorizing posts with a wide assortment of tags, and now you can browse all of those tags and get a list of all of the posts with those tags. The site uses six primary tags, which are as follows: comedy, technology, photo, idea, fiction, and personal. Now you can just see what you want to see out of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View all posts with a particular tag by going to denyconformity.com/TAG. This way, if you&#039;re only interested in looking at pictures, you can just go to denyconformity.com/photo, and you&#039;ll just get the posts about my photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, have fun browsing the list of tags (click the 'Tags' button at the top of the site), and as always, let me know if you find any bugs or problems so I can fix them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE - 6/7/2012</strong></p>\r\n<h5>BETA 0.4.5 - 'Defiant' (still)</h5>\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/tooltip.jpg' /><div class='caption'>The site&#039;s new tooltip.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 0.4.5 isn&#039;t a huge update. It just added a handy new tooltip feature that will hopefully give helpful information about some things when you put the mouse cursor on them. Try hovering over a timestamp in the timeline or here on the post page - it&#039;s neat! I&#039;ve also finally put together an 'About' page, which I&#039;m hoping will make it a bit easier to understand what&#039;s going on for visitors who are confused.</p>",

      "text": "\n\n<p>Hello, again, and welcome back to the epic story of my 2011 Halloween costume. First, we&#039;ll revisit the hat. You remember the paper shogun kap, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ongoing thing sure is taking a long time to finish, but at least it&#039;s dumb!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part whatever: Fixing the kap</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_1%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Remember when the kap just looked like this? We ended up having to throw away that carpet because Elliott kept peeing on it. He&#039;s not a great friend.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_2%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I took the ol&#039; multitool to the head branches. They had to be removable, so the whole thing would fit into a suitcase. Every day I worked on this thing I grew more frustrated that I didn&#039;t decide to go as 'guy with tiny hat' for Halloween.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_6%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I drilled a hole in the branch sticking out of the kap. I had to be careful not to drill into my head when I did this. Yes, in hindsight, it probably would have been easier to just take the kap off. It was just so comfortable.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_7%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>A wire glued into the branch would make the joint strong. Yes, the thing on the right side of the picture is a sock. I don&#039;t know why there&#039;s a sock there.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_9%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s the joint fully assembled, with some paper wrapped around to cover the gap. I would say it looked pretty good. In fact, I would even say that I would say it looked pretty good. I would go so far as to say that I would say that I said how good it would be. You might say that I have been known to talk about how I once said that I was talking to a guy about something . . . wait, what was I saying? Sometimes I get caught up in talking about what I&#039;m talking about.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_10%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>With the branches removed, the kap became much easier to work with. I added more paper to the bottom so that my face would be completely framed by paper, and the kap would cover more of my neck. I was desperate to cover as much skin as possible, because obviously any exposed skin would break the illusion of a paper grocery bag tree. I still had to cover the rim of the face hole with crumpled-up paper. Eh, that was a pretty unfortunate sentence.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_11%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Let&#039;s be honest. There&#039;s really nothing about this picture that makes me look cool.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/hat_2/hat2_12%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>So here&#039;s the kap after I finished the rim-job. There&#039;s got to be a better way to say that.</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part whatever plus one: Painting</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_1%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Andrew Monkey hooked me up with this pretty great spray paint. All I had to do was give him some money for them. It&#039;s a pretty great deal, if you ask me. I&#039;ve got bags full of the stuff buried in the backyard. I got these two colors, brown and greenish brown, to get a nice texture going. Andrew assured me that it was not glossy. Trees aren&#039;t shiny.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_2%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Remember to take these little washers out from under the nozzle before you try to use them. Also remember to take these little washers out from under the nozzle after you pack the cans in a bag with other stuff in it. Forgetting the former will leave you standing there all day getting no painting done. Forgetting the latter will leave you with the inside of your bag and whatever else you had in there nicely coated with a layer of high quality paint.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_3%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I tentatively applied a swath of paint. Painting always makes me a little nervous because it&#039;s so permanent. After this point, there would be no turning back. I would never be able to have my grocery bag armor again.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_4%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I started with the back of the torso, figuring that it would be the least prominent in the event that it didn&#039;t turn out great. I gave it a good coat of brown, hoping it wouldn&#039;t stay so glossy after it dried. Fortunately for Andrew, it did not stay very glossy.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_5%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s a closeup of the paint. It was too even and flat. I wanted more texture. I was hoping that the greenish grey color I also had would be able to make that happen for me.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_7%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s the kap after a nice coat of the brown stuff.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_8%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s one of the arms, with a stick inside to hold it up. I intentionally left a couple areas without much paint, thinking that it would accentuate the bark look. I found that by spraying at a very oblique angle, I could use the crinkles and crankles to get a nice uneven texture in the paint.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_9%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here you see both arms and one of the legs, with the torso just to the left of the shot. I didn&#039;t put much brown at the base of the leg, because I was going to have it be mainly greengray.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_11%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Speaking of which, the color was actually called 'Manila Dark.'</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_12%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s the back of the torso, again, after a bit of Manila Dark texturing.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_13%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Check out this sweet closeup. I used a paper bag bottom as a mask to get nice straight edges on some of the highlights. Long, straight ridges are very characteristic of tree bark.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_14%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>It came out pretty great on the front of the torso, if I do say so myself. In fact, I did say so myself. Actually, I would go so far, myself, to say that I would say so myself. If you must know, I even said - oh, sorry, I&#039;m doing it again.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_15%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Another closeup of the texture. You can see the straight edges here.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_18%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here you see one of the legs, one and a half of the arms, the bag bottom that I used as a mask, and my foot. I didn&#039;t paint my foot, but there it is, anyway.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/feet_19%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I also painted the sticks a bit to make them blend in a bit better with the color scheme. This was easier than finding a paint that perfectly matched the color of the sticks.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_10%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Back inside, now, it was time to put the finishing touches on the feet. If you&#039;re squeemish about people touching feet, don&#039;t worry, because these aren&#039;t really feet, and the touching is only figurative.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_11%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>For this, I turned to my good friend Sheet Moss, or Mousse Florale en Plaqu&eacute;.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_12%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Sheet Moss is a messy business. It&#039;s composed of a bunch of sheets all crammed into a little bag. Doing anything with Sheet Moss leaves lots of moss and dirt crumbs all over. At least this party was going to be at a stranger&#039;s house.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_13%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>The Sheet Moss was surprisingly easy to pull apart and hot glue to the paper. Making a mess with this stuff is inevitable, so it was just a matter of controlling where that mess happened.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_14%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>I used the Sheet Moss to cover up the gaps and seams in the foot, and also to provide some cool texture. I think it looked great, but I&#039;m sure not going to say so. Not this time.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_15%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Here you see the finished legs, with Sheet Moss expertly applied. It&#039;s <em>really</em> easy to become an expert in Sheet Moss, especially when - like me - you&#039;re already an expert in making messes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/costume/paint/paint_16%20copy.jpg'><div class='caption'>Did I mention that Sheet Moss is pretty messy? They really should call it Sheet Mess. So funny.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We have only one more chapter of this epic struggle to get through, but I promise it will be the cool one. You&#039;ll finally get to see this thing on my body, getting down. At least, I got down as well as a dude wearing a suit of grocery bag armor can get down. Stay tuned! I promise the last chapter won&#039;t take me more than a month to post.</p>\n\n",

Point and shoot cameras, and depressingly even cellphone cameras these days, are designed to take portraits and light action. Mid- to high-quality point and shoots allow you to adjust aperture settings, shutter speeds, and even sometimes ISO settings, allowing people in bars and family events to claim some level of intelligence and knowledge about photography. However, to take a truly good landscape, you need a high-quality lens, an extremely high aperture setting, the most stable possible tripod mount, and the ability to take shots at mid-range ISO settings without much noise. For all of those things, you really need an SLR. I&#039;ve been living in a city with one of the most recognizable skylines in the world, and I have not taken much advantage of it yet.

      "text": "\r\n<p>Not long ago, Alyson was reading a cosmopolitan magazine. I think it was called <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, actually. Don&rsquo;t worry, she isn&rsquo;t actually into the thing. We were on a bus trip, so neither of us had anything better to do. As she flipped through the magazine, she found a super handy sex tip (that magazine has all kind of tips and tricks for the ol&rsquo; saucy shuffle). The tip was, and I quote, &ldquo;Turn your cellphone off during sexy time.&rdquo; What a great idea. It inspired me to jot down a few of my own handy tips for really maximizing your pleasure-potentials. Here are my top ten, in one particular order (I&rsquo;ll let you decide what the order is!).</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Buy a bookmark. That way, you won&rsquo;t be distracted by having to keep your finger wedged in your favorite book.</li>\r\n<li>If your Mother is visiting this week, tell her to go check out that cool new art exhibit at some building five miles away. By the time she gets there and realizes she&rsquo;s been duped, you&rsquo;ll be able to get your business completed at least once. She&rsquo;ll be mad at you for tricking her, but that&rsquo;s better than having to explain what those &ldquo;strange noises&rdquo; were.</li>\r\n<li>Wash the dishes before you take anybody&rsquo;s pants off. You&rsquo;ll never get anything done with that crusty lasagna pan hanging over your head.</li>\r\n<li>If you live near a school, you should close your windows. Nothing kills the mood like hearing street vendors trying to sell ice cream and churros to kids at recess. We get it, dude, you&rsquo;ve got flavored ice for a dollar. I&rsquo;m trying to sow some oats here.</li>\r\n<li>I know it seems like a great time to think out the latest challenge at work or try to figure out what number goes in the corner square of your latest sudoku, but let me tell you something: it&rsquo;s not. When the nasty is being done, you have to keep your mind focused on the task (literally) at hand. You can&rsquo;t just sit there and let your mind wander. It&rsquo;s not like pooping. Just pause to write down what you&rsquo;re thinking about, then you&rsquo;ll be able to pick it right back up in a few minutes when it&rsquo;s all over with.</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s always a good idea to make sure your potential boots-knocker is actually interested in knocking on your boots before you get started. Nothing is more awkward than hearing &ldquo;ok, that&rsquo;s the last time I deliver a sandwich here&rdquo; when your pants are halfway off.</li>\r\n<li>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, but there just is no suitable snack for accompanying a hearty doing it session. You&rsquo;ll just have to wait until you&rsquo;re done, and then have some chippy snack  or ice cream or something (depending, of course, on how the doing it went). Remember to offer your partner some (again, depending on how the doing it went). If you disregarded number 2, make sure you offer your Mother some, too.</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s always a good idea the first time you get onto the casbah with somebody to make a big chart showing different parts of your bodies along with the relative sensitivity to tickling each part has. It&rsquo;s a time consuming process the first time, but boy is it worth it.</li>\r\n<li>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t keep paperwork on each of your partners in neatly organized folders labeled with each partner&rsquo;s name in a big file cabinet marked &ldquo;Fornication Files.&rdquo; You might think they will all appreciate your neatness and attention to detail, but man they really don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll apparently never live that one down.</li>\r\n<li>Always make sure you have a full range of the necessary supplies you might need, in case you have occasion to use them. You definitely don&#039;t want to be caught without the right things. You know what I mean. Actually, if you do know, let me know, because I&#039;ve never been sure.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>There you go! ten DenyConformity Top Tips for being the best at the beast (with two backs). That&#039;s totally free advice! Here&rsquo;s hoping my Mom doesn&rsquo;t read this and finds out that I thought about sex once!</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>I&#039;ve been pleased as punch with the response to the first excerpt from my new novel, <em>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</em>. I was so encouraged by all the positive feedback, in fact, that I have decided to release the next chapter for your consideration! Even though everybody seems to love it, for some reason I still haven&#039;t been sent an offer for the movie rights. Reminder: the movie rights are still available!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</h5>\r\n<p style='text-align: center; font-weight: bold'>Chapter 6</p>\r\n\r\n<p class='firstChar'>The reports did not look good. District Epsilon was way over quota. Recounting the numbers was not going to help, just as it had never helped before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maximum Chamberman of District District 5 Dorald Yugdab pulled at his chin, hoping that the numbers would add up if he counted them all one last time. It didn&rsquo;t work. His thoughtful grey eyes looked up from the Commpadd, burning a hole in Director Pagu, the poor soul whose duty it was to deliver this bad news. Yugdab did not have laser vision, but he might as well have had, as far as Pagu was concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do these numbers tell me?&rdquo; The Maximum Chamberman calmly asked. Yugdab spoke with a generic British accent, which obviously made him seem either intellectual, exotic, or aristocratic - it doesn&rsquo;t matter which.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Pagu could not adequately respond purely by sweating, but it didn&rsquo;t stop his body from trying. His mouth opened and closed as he tried to determine what Yugdab meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chamberman looked up at Pagu, his eyes narrowing. Pagu was staring intently at the pile of dogs curled up around the base of of the chamberseat upon which Yugdab sat. Like all Maximum Chambermen, Yugdab surrounded himself with comforts. His affinity for dogs was evident by his host of loyal canine pets. The host of beautiful, scantily clad ladies lining the chamber showed his affinity for scantily clad ladies. Nobody can really resist scantily clad ladies, really, and this grand setting featuring a lot of them would have been right at home as an important shot in a movie trailer. Pagu wondered what else Yugdab had an affinity for. He tried to remember if he had heard anything about laser vision. Pagu was a very nervous man who was always afraid that people had laser vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do these numbers tell me, Director?&rdquo; Yugdab asked again, saying each word clearly. His voice was level and - to Pagu - terrifyingly relaxed. Pagu hadn&rsquo;t become a District Director without learning an important lesson about what people sound like when they&rsquo;re angry. Yugdab had no reason to not be angry, Pagu knew, so it must have meant that he was really, extra, laser vision caliber angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;District Epsilon is . . . over quota . . . ?&rdquo; Pagu answered slowly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dorald Yugdab chuckled to himself. Handing the Commpadd to one of the Chamber aides, who were standing in a sweeping arc behind his plinth, Yugdab stood and stepped down to the Chamber floor. Standing level with Pagu, Yugdab still towered over him. History had proven that the tallest people were the best, and so it was no surprise that a man like Dorald Yugdab came to power. Standing exactly six feet eight inches tall, Yugdab cut an extremely imposing figure. He was a thin man, but he had the bearing of a genius, and his rugged good looks made everybody really like him, even if he was kind of a jerk. His red hair, cut short, and his smooth face were the paragon of fashion, and he always wore futuristic suits, which are basically like regular suits except they&rsquo;re kind of shiny and made of space-fabric. Even though Yugdab was pretty old and wise, one of the advantages of his high status was that genetic tampering and age treatments left him looking much younger, as if he were about in his mid twenties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;District Epsilon is over quota,&rdquo; Yugdab mused as he paced across the Chamber floor, looking absently at the host of scantily clad ladies. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the numbers mean, Director. What do they tell me?&rdquo; He was still talking with that cold, condescending way that would have really irritated Pagu if it hadn&rsquo;t terrified him to the point of inventing a new language using sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I . . . I don&rsquo;t . . .&rdquo; began Pagu, turning to Yugdab who was standing in the middle of the Chamber with his back to the poor Director, picking through some fruit which was piled on one of the scantily clad ladies. Yugdab was that cool - he had a scantily clad lady as a fruit bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab spun on his heel, throwing a long, narrow finger at the Director, screaming, &ldquo;It means that you haven&rsquo;t been doing your job, Director Pagu!&rdquo; Venom and hatred were overflowing from his once neutral face. Pagu was almost relieved to finally be getting the stern talking-to that he was expecting all along. Pagu was also relieved that the sudden outburst hadn&rsquo;t scared out of him what it almost scared out of him. He silently cursed his uniform standard white pants. He felt as if a thousand scantily clad lady eyes were on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Twenty seven districts I&rsquo;m in charge of and every single one of them is under quota except for yours!&rdquo; continued the Chamberman. Pagu flinched at each syllable, still waiting for the lasers to start firing from those deep, grey eyes. The pile of dogs stirred, and some of the dogs raised their heads as their master was getting angry. Suddenly it occurred to Pagu, counting dog heads, that there were quite a bit fewer dogs in that pile than he originally thought. Being torn to shreds by vicious gigantic dogs started to compete in his mind with being charred to a crisp by an angry man&rsquo;s eye lasers. <em>If he cooks me with his eye lasers, those dogs will eat me,</em> Pagu thought to himself, with a shiver down his spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pagu was not particularly aware of what Yugdab had said, but even if he had, he wouldn&rsquo;t have known that it wasn&rsquo;t true. District Epsilon was not the only district to be over-quota. In fact, many of the districts within District District 5 were over quotas or in some crisis or another. Yugdab was the only man who knew the truth about every district. He was a very shrewd politician and leader, sharing nothing with his subordinates. The ability to not tell your underlings that you aren&rsquo;t doing that great is a sign of a really good leader - something that Yugdab totally was. He slowly walked around Pagu, menacing him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You will increase the zombie count in District Epsilon by ten percent,&rdquo; Yugdab said, talking through clenched teeth to suppress the anger that was welling within him. Pagu was weighing the pros and cons of being eaten alive by giant dogs versus being fried to a crisp by angry lasers. Yugdab&rsquo;s clear order snapped the Director out of his mental turmoil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, that&rsquo;s not going to be easy . . .&rdquo; Pagu began. He wanted so desperately to just say &ldquo;yeah, sure, ok,&rdquo; but he knew it would be much worse to have to face these dogs and these lasers and who knows what else if he failed what was probably an impossible mission. It was obviously the most tactful solution to let Yugdab know now that what he wanted would be impossible. Pagu prided himself on his ability to tactfully find the path least likely to lead to his being lasered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then you had better get started, Director.&rdquo; Yugdab responded, returning to his plinth and collapsing back into his chamberseat. The dogs settled into a new pile arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pagu&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed ever so slightly, and he found himself once again fighting the urge to ruin his white pants. He raced through his mind, trying to run the numbers, visualising the spreadsheet displayed on the very commpadd he had just handed his boss. He hardly had enough idlers left in his district to afford mandating that many more zombies. Then he realized a thing he had thought earlier. <em>Who knows what else is waiting to destroy me besides the dogs and lasers?</em> Pagu thought to himself. He was suddenly aware of the vaulted ceiling above him, and the conspicuously tiled floor below. <em>I bet that ceiling opens up,</em> he thought to himself. <em>The ceiling opens up and, what, these floor tiles are on little catapults? Oh no, he&rsquo;s going to catapult me out of a 126 story building. He&rsquo;s going to catapult me and then he&rsquo;s going to skeet shoot me with his eye lasers and then his dogs are going to have raining breakfast.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab simply glared at the young Director. The Chamberman knew what was going through Pagu&rsquo;s head. Not the catapulting stuff - nobody just looking at the guy would know any of that. If someone were there who could read thoughts, they would probably feel extra important with this knowledge that Yugdab didn&rsquo;t have, just like people who watch movies after reading the book feel superior to those who skip the book. Yugdab was more interested Pagu&rsquo;s thoughts about the statistical analysis of his District&rsquo;s zombie counts. Before today, Yugdab had little faith in Pagu, and now he had none. This young Director had proven his inability to understand the nuance of Government Mandate Zones, seeing things purely as numbers on a spreadsheet. Yugdab knew, though, that mandating citizens went far beyond simply running the numbers. Pagu&rsquo;s district, District Epsilon, was a major source of manufactured goods for the rest of the districts in the District. As a result, the workers in District Epsilon were cocky, thinking they could drink all the delicious Coke and eat all the Taco Bell that they wanted. In all fairness, anybody would feel inclined to do that, because those are both really delicious and satisfying things. However, the Government had to make an example of these workers, to show them - and the neighboring districts - that Government Mandate Zones were not to be trifled with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would industry suffer? Marginally, perhaps, but the overall increase in productivity as citizens buckled down in fear of the Mandate would more than make up for it. Besides, zombies could work most machinery just as well as many of the citizens in District Epsilon. These sorts of things went right over Pagu&rsquo;s head, but Yugdab was such a great thinker that it came naturally to him - and he was so good at expressing himself that someone just looking at his face as he glared there would have picked up all of this cool background information just from his subtle facial expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pagu bowed his head obediently, giving Yugdab a &ldquo;yes, sir.&rdquo; He turned with the efficiency of a bureaucrat and nervously walked the long length of the chamber to the grand exit. With each step he became more sure that the tile beneath him would launch him like a clay pigeon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab watched the man walk away. He turned to one of his aides and called him by name, which was &ldquo;Cranden.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cranden obediently responded. Yugdab knew each of his sixty three aides up and down. He knew their strengths and weaknesses, so he would know exactly who would be best suited for each of his myriad tasks. For example, he knew that one of his aides, named Ruddle, was almost completely useless, except for the most basic of tasks, which is why he chose that aide to hold his commpadds for him. Ruddle often even managed to screw that up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cranden was an excellent aide, however. He had served the Chamberman for almost six years, and Yugdab knew the time had come for the young man to get the promotion he deserved. With his eyes still fixed on Director Pagu, making his way daintily out of the chamber, he gave the orders that would change two men&rsquo;s lives forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It will be up to you to see that zombie count is mandated.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;And see to it that former Director Pagu is the first one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab leveled his expressive eyes on the aide. &ldquo;Congratulations, District Director Cranden,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slightest hint of a grin showed on the new Director&rsquo;s face. His time had finally come. All he could say was, &ldquo;thank you, sir,&rdquo; which is why he said exactly that before stepping out of line and heading out of the chamber. It was Cranden&rsquo;s job, now, to set about giving Pagu a fate worse than death - worse even, perhaps, than being launched, cooked, and eaten by catapult, laser, and dog, respectively. It was common knowledge that it was really annoying to be a zombie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maximum Chamberman of District District 5 Dorald Yugdab allowed himself a brief moment to reflect. There was much to do, and he could afford very little time to staring off thoughtfully, but those sorts of things really make a character look like they have a lot going on, so that&rsquo;s what he did. Only for a moment, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he stood, briskly making his way to the side door, which led to his personal offices. &ldquo;Ruddle, come with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the rest of you are dismissed.&rdquo; He had found that the only way to keep Ruddle from being completely, utterly, sometimes destructively useless was if he kept the dullard at his side at all times. Only under the strictest of supervision could the boy - he was 17 and looked like a poor man&rsquo;s Michael Cera - get anything done without making a mess of it. Yugdab occasionally found himself checking to make sure he hadn&rsquo;t recruited a zombie by mistake. As the two of them approached his office, the other aides, the scantily clad ladies, and the pile of dogs all shuffled offscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab kept the simple lad around because there was something about the glassy look of his eyes, the blank expression on his face, and the perpetually open mouth that made it easy for Yugdab to open up to him. He was able to talk through his plans, as he paced back and forth in front of his giant office window. Yugdab had always found it useful to voice his ideas, and in the process they would somehow fit together and reform as even better ones, like taking ice out of a freezer to melt a little bit and then putting it back in so that it all froze into one giant supercube. The Chamberman&rsquo;s ideas were like perfectly formed ice cubes, but by sounding them out and fitting them together, he could create the most supercube of ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, Yugdab&rsquo;s technique was not unlike that of a writer, blindly stabbing at mixed metaphors and misplaced symbolism in the hope that eventually some words will happen to fit together into a coherent sentence or two. To Yugdab, Ruddle was like a big whiteboard which Yugdab could throw darts at until he happened to collect enough ingredients for an idea-sandwich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long ago, when Yugdab was actually younger, and not just synthetically younger, Yugdab had had a stuffed bear, his cherished possession. He spent hours sharing his secrets and his schemes with that bear, in the privacy of his bedroom. He never knew what happened to his beloved Bobo, but he found a certain similarity in the inanimate stuffing of this Ruddle. One difference was that Ruddle wasn&rsquo;t quite as good at holding important commpadds as the stuffed bear, but Yugdab had grown to expect that by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they came through the office door, Ruddle managed to stumble over the threshold, as he always did, and drop one of the commpadds he was holding, as if doing so specifically to illustrate his incompetence. Yugdab ignored it. He had given up trying to force some sense into the boy. He was already launching into his train of thought for the afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Another district over quota, Ruddle. These citizens are getting harder to keep under mandate. How do they expect us to survive with what we have if they keep insisting on taking more than their share?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Ruddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab looked over at the blank face, which was breathing through its mouth as always. &ldquo;Do you remember what I told you about rhetorical questions, Ruddle?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;. . . uh . . . no,&rdquo; replied Ruddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab simply sighed and looked back out the window. The view was quite impressive from the chamber atop the 126-story District District headquarters building, in the heart of District Alpha. Yugdab knew he could see all the way to the edges of his District District, and he glared at the thought of District District 4, and the ever present competition of Maximum Chamberman Auldis Doogon just over the horizon. He went back to the thoughts inside his beautiful little head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven districts. Each one with countless citizens, all striving to be the best they can. What gives them all the opportunities to prosper, Ruddle? We do! The Government Mandates keep these districts from falling apart. I do. Just think what a difference I could make if I were selected to be Chamberman of District District 1! Chamberman Zeldo&rsquo;s health is declining by the day. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time, now, before someone will be asked to take his place. It should be me! I know I&rsquo;m the best suited. I know the chamber of elders see me as the obvious choice. If only that damned Doogon weren&rsquo;t always one step ahead of me. They&rsquo;re just waiting for one of us to slip up, to give way for the other to take District District 1 and the world. I won&rsquo;t be the one to make a mistake. I won&rsquo;t let Auldis Doogon take what&rsquo;s rightfully mine. What does he know about Government Mandates, anyway? Have you seen the reports of District District 4 Mandate Zones?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruddle was pleased to finally have a question he knew the answer to. &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like he doesn&rsquo;t even care about quotas! Why, in his wheat processing district, citizens are allowed to shop at Macy&rsquo;s as much as they want! How can they possibly keep order when they can go to such a wonderful and quite affordable under any budget department store for all of their domestic needs? Where&rsquo;s the supply for that? How can everyone in an entire district get fashionable accessories? I can&rsquo;t even imagine! Think of District Sigma, or even Epsilon. Millions of people live in those districts. We don&rsquo;t have enough of this season&rsquo;s hottest styles for everyone in one Mandate Zone, let alone a District, or by damn, the entire District District!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruddle thoughtfully made bubbles with his spit. He was getting quite good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Ruddle? Every man, woman, zombie, robot, and child out there is a District, and I won&rsquo;t rest until each and every last one of them is mandated! I&rsquo;ll mandate them a hundred times if it means I can stay one step ahead of that blasted Doogon and his free spirited ways!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, a familiar dingle dongle sounded from the door to the Chamber room. As Yugdab turned, the door opened to reveal one of his aides - a quite tech savvy young man whom Yugdab had stationed in the radio surveillance department. Yugdab expressed his frustration at having his train of thought derailed with a quick, &ldquo;whatisit?&rdquo; The toxic chemicals contained within his train cars of thought were spilling all over the innocent villages of thought inside his vast mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry to bother you, sir, but you requested to be notified if a particular set of frequencies was detected.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yugdab immediately perked up, then composing himself again - careful to hide his excitement from these aides - he asked, &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, we picked it up. It showed up yesterday morning, in the outskirts of District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone, and it took us some time to confirm. It seemed to have come from District Delta, which makes sense, sir. I believe we were unable to pick up the signal before now because it was being masked by interference from the high concentration of robot farms in that district.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see. You have a report, there?&rdquo; Yugdab gestured toward the commpadd in the aide&rsquo;s hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I prepared a complete report for you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aide began to hand the report to Ruddle, as was customary by now, but Yugdab quickly stepped forward and took the commpadd from the aide himself. He hated having to show the slightest interest in the report, but he just couldn&rsquo;t bear to see Ruddle drop this one on the floor, for the great possibilities that the report could signify. With as much nonchalance as he could muster, he took the commpadd to his desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you, that will be all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aide left with a nod. Yugdab stared at the report, looking for the specific frequencies indicated. He would have read the data to himself, but this is really important exposition, so he spoke to Ruddle as he processed what he saw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There are the frequencies, alright. I had almost forgotten. After all these years . . . Why now? It seems awfully dubious that these frequencies should emerge now, with me so close to being promoted to District District 1. There&rsquo;s only one thing for it, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;ll have to get to the bottom of this. I&rsquo;ll have to choose my best aide to find the source of this signal, and bring it back to me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riddle got excited. &ldquo;Me sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Yugdab replied. He set the pad down and took another moment to reflect. Two moments in one day was certainly a lot of reflection time, but he certainly deserved it after the last several pages. He had a lot of planning to do. He had just sent his best aide to a new assignment, and now he had to pick another one to waste his time on what could very well be a wild goose chase through the streets and alleyways of an entire District. He wondered if this was a ploy by Doogon to sap his resources. One thing was for sure, though. Life was never dull for the Maximum Chamberman in District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone!</p>\n\n",

      "title": "Ads on DenyConformity.com",
      "text": "\r\n<p>For the last few days, there have been no ads on DenyConformity.com. I suppose that isn&rsquo;t really a surprise. Before about a week ago, there had never been ads on DenyConformity.com. However, this is an annoying and frustrating turn of events. I want to be serious about this website, and so far I&rsquo;m pretty proud of myself (this is the ninth day of consecutive updates!). However, to be able to take this seriously, I will need to come up with some way to pay for it. I&rsquo;m afraid I will have to come up with a new solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was using Google AdSense, a pretty simple system to potentially monetize web content. The idea is that you put some code on your website that Google gives you, and then when people go to the site they&rsquo;ll see ads that are tailored to the content on your site. It uses Google&rsquo;s fancy algoribbons to pick ads that are related to the stuff on the site (at least for the most part). When visitors click on the ads, you get a very tiny cut. Through my testing process over the last few months, and the first week of the new DenyConformity.com&rsquo;s life, it worked perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have two ad locations. One is on the main timeline, at the top of the page. It&rsquo;s a leaderboard size ad, which falls back to a smaller banner if the screen is smaller, and a mobile banner if the viewer is on a smartphone (or has a tiny browser window for some reason). On the post page (the page you&rsquo;re reading this on), a skyscraper floats to the right side of the content. This ensures that the user has one ad on any page that contains content, and they aren&rsquo;t obnoxious or in the way. With AdSense, I was getting ads for costumes, Chicago businesses, and sci-fi novels, among other things. I felt that those things were pretty accurate for the content I have here.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/site_beta/broken_ad.png' height='260' width='1014'><div class='caption'>This is what my ads look like now. How will my readers get access to <em>Cool Runnings</em> costumes (an actual ad I saw here a few days ago)?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I guess it didn&rsquo;t exactly work perfectly. The problem is that I made an uncomfortable bed for myself with this ridiculously complicated and ambitious design. There are plenty of reasons why the site looks the way it does, but the problem is that it doesn&rsquo;t really cooperate with Google AdSense. You see, AdSense has some pretty hefty caveats. First, it has to load with the page, so you can&rsquo;t load ads with Javascript after the page has loaded. Second, their ad code is for one specific size, and one specific size only. Third, their crazy terms specify that their ads can&rsquo;t exist inside iframes. They stipulate these things for very specific and justified reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is that a problem for me, though? Well, first, since my site only had one page load, and all the content is pulled using Javascript, I have to be able to load ads dynamically. Second, this site is responsive, which means that the same page will load on any size screen, be it a phone, tablet, netbook, or 30-inch cinema display. I can&rsquo;t load the same size ads for a smartphone as I load for a 30-inch monitor, so the ads on my site have to also be responsive. Finally, the only way I can overcome those problems is by loading their ad code in an iframe, which I can then reload dynamically depending on window size, device, user navigation, or whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I figured they would have a problem with what I was doing, but since I was just bending their rules to make it work, I hoped that they could work with me and perhaps make an exception. They say the rule of thumb is, &ldquo;whether you&rsquo;d feel comfortable explaining what you&rsquo;ve done to a website that competes with you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ask, &lsquo;Does this help my users?&rsquo;&rdquo; Every choice I made was specifically with my users in mind, and I am not ashamed of anything I did on this new design. However, when I started getting impressions and (a tiny amount of) clicks, they simply shut me down. My account is suspended, my ads are disabled, and all of my requests for further information or support have gone unanswered. After perusing the AdSense forums, it is my strong opinion that with what I&rsquo;ve got going on, I&rsquo;m not getting AdSense back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t blame them. This is a world that entire industries have popped up to take advantage of and cheat. We&rsquo;re talking about a thing where you can put ads on a web page and you get money every time somebody clicks on them. I can think of about fifty different ways somebody could screw with that to get free money just off the top of my head. Basically, after years of dealing with garbage, Google isn&rsquo;t messing around, and they don&rsquo;t have time to deal with violators, legitimate or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, fine, I can tell when I&rsquo;m not wanted. Using Google AdSense was a bit of a shortcut, anyway. It was a cheap way out, and that&rsquo;s not the DenyConformity way. If there&rsquo;s anything that defines this website, it&rsquo;s that we do things the very, very hard - and usually dumb (but at hopefully at least entertaining) way. I just need to figure out the proper DenyConformity.com approach to ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, I&rsquo;m actually all for advertising in general. I think it serves a valuable purpose, namely to give people access to free stuff. If I can maintain this website, get paid for it, and still let people out there come here and get a laugh or two for free, I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. The fact is that this would be a much more expensive world - I mean absolutely anything you spend money on - if we didn&rsquo;t have ads. As long as they aren&rsquo;t getting in the way or making things more difficult, I&#039;m happy to have them around. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t see it as a &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; move to try to get a little ad revenue here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t want to sit here and defend my motivations for trying to monetize this project, because there&rsquo;s nothing to justify. I&rsquo;ve spent more time working on this website than I&rsquo;ve spent on anything else in my entire life, and I know that I&rsquo;ve provided a respectable amount of entertainment value to the world. The simple fact is that I deserve to be compensated for what I&rsquo;ve done, and I need capital to continue working on it as I move forward. End of story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can I raise that capital? Should I have annual pledge drives, like PBS? Should I quietly but regularly ask for donations from my visitors? That relies pretty heavily on my audience being pretty generous (and have plenty of disposable income). Should I get some t-shirts or other swag and sell them at reasonably marked up prices? That worked for Homestar. Should I start selling prints of the photos I&rsquo;ve posted here? Should I solicit ads myself, personally finding companies to advertise directly to my tens of regular visitors? As the site&rsquo;s presence grows (and I&rsquo;m hoping that with my new focus on regular updates it will), that might actually become somewhat viable. Should I start a subscription service, where most of my content is behind a paywall that requires some sort of modest fee? Should I start trying to write commercially, and sell stuff I write to actual big-time publishers and websites?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is, I&rsquo;m going to start working on looking into all of the above. Stick around and help me try out some of these things that I should have been looking into long before now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for your continued support!</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "The Parker Jotter",
      "text": "\n\n<p>A DenyConformity.com review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Safford Parker is a classic example of the American Dream. In 1888, Parker was fed up with having to constantly repair the fountain pens he sold for the John Holland Pen Company, so he did what anybody back then did - he made his own. In 1891, Parker found his first investor, and went on to forge one of the largest pen companies in the world, from a rickety (and presumably ink-stained) shack in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For decades, Parker was essentially the Mercedes Benz of writing instruments (sort of a Mercedes Penz, if you will). Year after year, Parker continued to innovate and perfect the fountain pen, taking a short break at one point to invent the mechanical pencil. Later, just after his death, Parker (the company) released the Parker 51, &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Most Wanted Pen.&rdquo; It was in every way revolutionary, technologically advanced, and beautiful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/parker51.jpg' class='noprint' height='625' width='400'></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>The most popular fountain pen ever made.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a time when perfectly useful pens weren&rsquo;t sitting around pretty much everywhere. To own a nice, dependable pen was a pretty important thing for a gentleman, like owning a nice car or pocket watch fob or something. If you needed a good pen, you had a &ldquo;51.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/jodl%20copy.jpg' class='noprint' height='468' width='700'></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>Even if you were a Nazi.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1945, Nazi General Alfred Jodl signed the treaty which ended World War II in Europe. He used, of course, his own trustworthy fountain pen - a Parker 51. Remember, Parker started in Wisconsin. Here we were, in the clutches of war, fighting over who could rule the world, and Parker was a trusted name on both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/rockwell-61%20copy.jpg' class='noprint' height='517' width='700'></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>Also there&rsquo;s this.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the American Dream doesn&rsquo;t end there. Parker (the guy)&rsquo;s dream of &ldquo;making a better pen&rdquo; lived on for decades, until it gave way to the new American Dream, a multinational corporation. In 1993 Parker (the company) was acquired by Gillette, and then in 2000 they were purchased by Newell Rubbermaid, parent company of Sanford, which is now the largest stationery company in the world. Sanford (and Rubbermaid) also owns Sharpie, PaperMate, Liquid Paper, Prismacolor, Waterman, and Uniball. In 2009, Rubbermaid decided to close down Parker&rsquo;s factory in Janesville, Wisconsin, where Parker (the guy) originally founded the company over 120 years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parker (the guy)&rsquo;s legacy lives on, however, and many excellent pens are still made under the Parker (the name) name. The Sonnet and Duofold continue the legacy of the venerable &ldquo;51,&rdquo; and the Jotter, introduced in 1954, is in its 58th year of production. As far as I can tell, that makes the Jotter the longest running cartridge-based ballpoint pen in history. A few weeks ago, I bought my very own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/IMG_9172%20copy.jpg' height='467' width='700'></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its design and construction has changed somewhat since it was first introduced. Today the Jotter primarily comes with a stainless steel cap and button with a plastic or steel barrel and a metal nozzle. Beginning a few years after its introduction, Parker fit the Jotter (in fact all of its pens) with the characteristic Parker Arrow clip. Parker makes a big deal about how the Arrow clip will let everybody you see know that you don&rsquo;t have just any pen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/IMG_9187.jpg' style='max-width: 500px' height='1128' width='752'></p>\r\n<div class='caption'>That&rsquo;s one of the most pretentious things I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Far more important than the stupid arrow clip is the Jotter&rsquo;s tungsten carbide writing ball. Introduced in 1957, the &ldquo;T-Ball&rdquo; refill was the first of its kind. Pretty much all ballpoints have a similar design today, so the legacy of Parker innovation is right at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the hand the Jotter feels incredibly light, especially compared to similar steel-body retractable pens like the Zebra F-402. That certainly has to do with the fact that the model I have been using features a plastic barrel, but even the all steel model feels just as light. The action of the button is quite heavy compared to other retractable pens (in a good way), and at the risk of sounding pretentious, that satisfying click is the most characteristic feature of the entire pen. It feels louder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/IMG_9185%20copy.jpg' style='max-width: 500px' height='1050' width='700'></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looks great, too. The smooth curves and brushed steel give the pen some serious elegance. In the world of retractable ballpoints, you really can&rsquo;t find a classier pen. Faintly etched around the middle seam are the Parker emblem and name, as well as, for some reason, &ldquo;France.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re obviously trying to make the pen seem grander than it is. Let&rsquo;s face it, Parker was founded in a garage in Wisconsin. It was only in 2009 that Rubbermaid moved the company&rsquo;s production to France. Aside from the ham-fisted branding, I doubt the French have had much influence over the pen&rsquo;s classic design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the pen apart, and you get a look at the real Parker legacy, the ink cartridge itself. When the Jotter was introduced, it was the first ballpoint with a serious replaceable cartridge. It originally would last more than five times longer than other ballpoints at the time. Since then, refill cartridges have been standardized and modern industry has perfected their construction, so the &ldquo;Quinkflow&rdquo; ballpen refill isn&rsquo;t as amazing as it once would have been. My pen has the Medium point, but a fine point option is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jotter&rsquo;s diminutive size and elegant design do come with a downside, of course. The pen features no rubberized grip or ergonomic finger grooves, and those lovely curves actually mean the spot where you grip the pen is relatively small. It&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t get used to, for sure, but if you&rsquo;re more familiar with more substantial writing instruments (or you have giant monster hands), you&rsquo;ll find your fingers cramping up just a bit. I also noticed a few times while using the Jotter that the tip extends from the barrel just a tiny bit less than most other pens. This must sound terribly pedantic, but it is actually a bit disconcerting. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just me, but there&rsquo;s something ever so awkward about writing with that tip only half-way out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days a ballpoint pen&rsquo;s ink isn&rsquo;t terribly startling. A ballpoint&rsquo;s a ballpoint, certainly as far as most end users should be concerned. The ultimate problem with the Jotter is that it is, in fact, just a ballpoint, and so it is ultimately victim to the problems that beset ballpoint pens. Pretty recently, my Jotter has started doing the thing that most ballpoint pens do at one point or another. Basically, it turns into a sort of embossing pen instead of an ink pen. This is a result of the fact that ballpoints are actually based mainly on luck. The ink will stop flowing over the ball, no matter what kind of carbide it is, and the only marks you get on your paper are the shameful marks of a ballpoint that doesn&rsquo;t work. In other words, you have a bunch of those &ldquo;make it write&rdquo; scribbles in your margins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It only happens sometimes, but I kind of don&rsquo;t expect it from something from <em>France</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/parker_jotter/IMG_9181%20copy.jpg' style='max-width: 500px' height='1050' width='700'></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So since I don&rsquo;t really have metrics to judge pens, yet, and since this is the first pen I&rsquo;ve reviewed, it&rsquo;s hard for me to sum this review up. The Jotter is an excellent pen - perhaps the best ballpoint I&rsquo;ve used in my entire life. It comes down to a few important questions, though. Sanford has really reduced the ubiquity of Parkers since they bought the company. Maybe it&rsquo;s a move to make them seem more &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; or maybe they&rsquo;re just cutting corners. The end result is that it&rsquo;s supposedly not terribly easy to find Jotters anywhere. I got mine at Office StapleMax or whatever, and there are certainly plenty of Jotters online, so they aren&rsquo;t actually that difficult to find. The real problem is price. At about $6 per pen, they&rsquo;re more than twice the cost of a Zebra F-402, which is a pen I used faithfully for years before somebody &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; it a few months ago. Sure, $6 is not terribly much, but is it really worth that much more than the Zebra? I guess I&rsquo;ll let you know when I review the Zebra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other question is one of morality. What has happened to Parker (the legacy)? What was an American - nay, a Worldwide - tradition has become a boutique novelty. Parker (the company) is now a pretentious arm of a faceless conglomerate bent on world domination. Should we disregard the obnoxious &ldquo;France&rdquo; rebranding? Should you buy this artificially rare object of groan-inducing pretense, shamelessly abandoning the respectable legacy of an almost forgotten man from American history? Will you buy a Parker Jotter and support this cycle of corporate greed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, no. You&rsquo;ll buy a Parker Jotter because it&rsquo;s a really good pen - the stainless steel standard by which all pens shall be judged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The Parker ads and the picture of Jodl came to me from Google)</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>A DenyConformity.com Guide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to the world of public transportation! So you found yourself wanting to be somewhere, and you came to the conclusion that you had to take the bus. Despair no more! A city bus is a logical place, governed by a strict set of rules. Those rules may seem intimidating to someone who isn&rsquo;t a professional bus rider. No longer! With this handy pocket guide (if you open it on your smartphone it is, anyway) you can act like  one of the bus riding elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/guide_logo.jpg' height='215' width='700'><div class='caption'>Fig. 0 - The logo for this guide</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone knows that the moment a member of the non-bus-riding community - a Sidewalker, as bus riders call them - sets foot on a bus full of professionals they will be laughed at and mocked with a precision that is unequalled in other areas of professional public interaction. If you have truly exhausted all other methods of traveling to your destination and you cannot think of a way to get there without riding a bus, you cannot step onto the bus looking like you don&rsquo;t belong. The following steps will not help Sidewalkers turn themselves into professional riders, but they&rsquo;ll at least be turned into professional fakers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Step One: Know your Bus</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_twodoor.jpg' height='209' width='800'><div class='caption'>Fig. 1 - The Standard eight-row, two-door Single Decker</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A professional bus rider spends years studying the seating layouts, intertia ratings, smell zones, and average speeds of an entire city&rsquo;s bus armada. Without a lifetime to devote to knowing these minute details, you must do your best to fake this knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_bendy.jpg' height='98' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 2 - The Middle-Hinged Double Single Decker</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These diagrams showcase the most standard types of bus employed by cities across the United States. Make yourself familiar with them, to call into your mind as you step onto the bus. When you make your way to a seat with confidence, the scornful eyes of the professionals on the bus will think you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_eyecontact.jpg' height='196' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 3 - Two-door Single Decker Variant: &ldquo;The Awkward Eye Contact&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Always remember that you can count on a few things being true on every bus you are forced to ride on. First, every bus has wheels. This is something that can be very comforting, because you can know that the wheels on your bus will go round and round all through the town. Unless, of course, the bus breaks down or has a crash. Also, the pigs on the bus go &ldquo;oink, oink, oink&rdquo; e-i-e-i-o. Wait, that can&rsquo;t be right . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_inquiry.jpg' height='206' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 4 - Two-door Single Decker Variant: &ldquo;The Board of Inquiry&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not a guarantee that the bus you are about to enter has the same layout of seats that you might be ready for - or that it has any seats at all. Bus makers get very bored, because making a bus is really boring, so they will change the seating layout for no reason. Because of this, almost every bus you enter will have a completely different seating arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_noseater.jpg' height='196' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 5 - Two-door no-seater Single Decker (&ldquo;The Cattle Car&rdquo;)</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When standing on a bus - which you will have to do if you find a bus with no seats - remember to hold on to something attatched to the bus, and not the person next to you (see &ldquo;Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s,&rdquo; below).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_aerostar.jpg' height='368' width='700'><div class='caption'>Fig. 6 - The McCutcheon Family&rsquo;s Ford Aerostar</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The City picks bus sizes based on the population density of the area they are serving. If you live in a tiny city without many people, you might just have to talk to someone who lives down the street from you and treat their car like the bus. You can have fun making their car filthy, and they can have fun yelling &ldquo;exact change&rdquo; at you, and not stopping to pick you up when they see you standing at the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_train.jpg' height='43' width='800'><div class='caption'>Fig. 7 - The Triple-hinged Tetrabus (nicknamed &ldquo;The Subway&rdquo;)</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes a bus isn&rsquo;t actually a bus. These are called &ldquo;trains.&rdquo; They are faster and scarier than a bus, but most of the same rules apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_magic.jpg' height='319' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 8 - One-door Magic Single Decker</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many schools employ a bus battalion to ferry students between home and school. Remember that when you see one of these bright yellow affronts to design they will not pick you up. They aren&rsquo;t there to take you to work even if you have the $2.25 for them - unless you work at school, and you&rsquo;re 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_omnibus.jpg' height='539' width='600'><div class='caption'>Fig. 9 - The City Omnibus</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &ldquo;bus&rdquo; actually comes from the Olde English &ldquo;Omnibus&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;every smell.&rdquo; The first bus was built in 1794, as a transportation device for crates of stinky cheese. The actual content of the bus might have changed in the intervening years, but basically everything else is the same - including the smell.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/type_greyhound.jpg' height='523' width='700'><div class='caption'>Fig. 10 - The Greyhound</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Some forms of bus go long distances, from city to city. Sometimes these are called a Mega Bus, because they beat up smaller vehicles. However, these are not a city bus, and so they are outside the scope of this guide.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Step Two: Behave Like a Pro</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You might think that everyone on the bus is drunk. This is only partially true. The reality is that everyone on the bus merely looks drunk. When you first set foot on the bus, you will experience a moment of disorientation, as if your entire world were suddenly racing along at around five miles per hour. That is only the bus, meandering down the street to the next bus stop. Try to maintain your composure as you make you way down the bus aisle, but keep in mind that looking like you&rsquo;re having trouble keeping your balance is perfectly natural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike drunk people, however, bus riders follow very strict rules of conduct. If you want to fit in, and keep your trip from being even more worse than it already is, you should stick to these rules, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_1.jpg' height='529' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 11 - Fill as large a space as you can.</div>\r\n<p>This is the most important rule that all Professional Bus Riders follow. You can use your imagination and be creative. Put your feet up, sit diagonally, or bring a giant backpack with you. Bus riders don&rsquo;t keep score, but if they did, it would be based on how much space you take up. Be the largest person on the bus, and you win!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_2.jpg' height='682' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 12 - Don&rsquo;t scoot over unless someone tells you to.</div>\r\n<p>The important distinction here is that you can disregard other passengers who merely ask you to move. The answer is always no.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_3.jpg' height='650' width='650'><div class='caption'>Fig. 13 - Smell as bad as you can.</div>\r\n<p>It can help if you know you will be having a bus trip in your future, because you can go without bathing or changing your underpants for a few days. What causes the stink is up to you. Some riders keep urine-soaked towels with them so they always have a perfect bus-worthy stench at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_4.jpg' height='523' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 14 - When someone gets up from a seat in front of you, do not sit in the seat.</div>\r\n<p>By all means, there&rsquo;s no reason why you should take that empty seat right in front of you, especially if the bus is full of people. If nobody behind you can sit there, why should you?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_5.jpg' height='638' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 15 - Always get up while the bus is in motion.</div>\r\n<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but real pros don&rsquo;t wait until their stop has arrived. Get up from your seat several blocks ahead of your stop, making sure to only move when the bus is moving. This ensures that you cause the biggest disruption as you leave - your other primary goal aside from taking up as much space as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_6.jpg' height='707' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 16 - When two adjacent seats open up, it&rsquo;s first come, first served.</div>\r\n<p>Two adjacent empty seats are like a big, delicious Value Meal to bus riders. When someone gets up from a seat, leaving a pair of adjacent seats open, those seats are officially up for grabs. They will become the domain of whoever gets there first, so keep an eye open for these succulent prizes, and grab them before one of those selfish people standing in the aisle get it. Then you can sit on the aisle seat, blocking those whiny Elderly and Infirm from moving in on your domain. Also important: never sit next to someone you are riding the bus with. If you are traveling with a friend, consider sitting a few rows apart, because yelling to each other is much more fun than casually talking to someone sitting next to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_7.jpg' height='878' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 17 - No matter how many people are on the bus, it can always hold more.</div>\r\n<p>First, it goes without saying that if you&rsquo;re waiting at a bus stop you should make sure you get in front of everybody else waiting at the bus stop, so when the bus stops you get first dibs of any open seats on the bus. When those doors open and you see a solid wall of humanity because the city has cut funding to the bus system so there isn&rsquo;t enough room for everyone, do not hesitate. Only Sidewalkers do something lame like wait for the next bus. You could be standing there, looking like an idiot, for whole minutes!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_8.jpg' height='196' width='750'><div class='caption'>Fig. 18 - Maintain the accepted standing zones.</div>\r\n<p>Always stand your ground when you&rsquo;re standing on a bus. That is, awkwardly stagger your ground, because that is most likely the best you can do with the bus driver constantly slamming on the brakes like they&rsquo;re trained to do. If more people start to collect in the aisle, you are in no way obligated to make your way farther back, and you especially don&rsquo;t have to stand in the raised area in the back. Consider it a demilitarized zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_9.jpg' height='217' width='500'><div class='caption'>Fig. 19 - Bring a snack.</div>\r\n<p>Going minutes without eating usually gives most professional bus riders the shakes. Because of this, you should bring a snack along to fit in. As soon as they see you not having withdrawal from McDonald&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re not meant to be there. Unshelled sunflower seeds and the smelliest of Italian beef are the best snacks to enjoy on the bus. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, &ldquo;would I eat this thing in the presence of someone else when not on the bus?&rdquo; If you say no, you&rsquo;ve found a perfect snack for a crowded bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_10.jpg' height='272' width='400'><div class='caption'>Fig. 20 - Bring the proper entertainment.</div>\r\n<p>Bus Riders don&rsquo;t read books. A newspaper is good, only because it requires you to keep your arms wide while reading it, helping you take up more space - just remember to leave the newspaper on your seat when you get off the bus. A cellphone is another great option, especially if it has a good speakerphone option. The bus is a great place to make personal phone calls. If you find yourself without anything to do, strike up an argument with the empty seat next to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_11.jpg' height='2783' width='3168'><div class='caption'>Fig. 21 - Use proper language.</div>\r\n<p>You are on a bus, not an elementary school. If anything, you have an expletive minimum. If you are having a conversation with your friend two rows down, someone on your phone, or the empty seat next to you, feel free to shovel d-, a- and especially f-bombs into your parlance as much as you can. You get extra points if you are sitting next to a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bus_guide/rule_12.jpg' height='3438' width='2632'><div class='caption'>Fig. 22 - Disregard the Elderly, the Infirm, and Expectant Mothers</div>\r\n<p>What, are you running a charity? Where do those geezers need to go in such a hurry? Isn&rsquo;t walking a necessary component of physical rehab, anyway? What, her baby daddy couldn&rsquo;t borrow his mom&rsquo;s car for the afternoon? Most Elderly, Infirm, and Expectant Mothers you see on the bus are faking their condition, just so they can cheat and take your seat away from you. Those big walkers and huge bellies? They&rsquo;re just a ploy so these people can take up as much space as possible. Are you going to let them beat you at what is now your own game? While we&rsquo;re on the subject, have you noticed the funny symbols on the seats in the front of the bus? That weird picture of a guy with wheels? It&rsquo;s just there as a joke. Of course you have wheels - you&rsquo;re on a bus!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Step Three: Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>DO NOT eat anything you find on the bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO NOT stow your bike on the bike rack. Did you smash your bike? What are you doing on the bus?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO take advantage of the fact that the bus is just really big trash can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO assume everybody else on the bus is inferior to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO NOT utilize your lap. Your stuff has as much right to a seat on the bus as you do, and more right than that grumpy-looking person standing in the aisle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO always give money to anybody on the bus who asks for it. There&rsquo;s a strict honor code among Bus Riders, so that guy who needs a couple bucks will definitely get you back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO whatever the stinkiest, noisiest person on the bus is doing, because they&rsquo;re the best at riding a bus, and if you act like them, you&rsquo;ll get extra respect from the pros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO NOT rely on another person for support while the bus is in motion. That person is teetering on the brink of falling over just as much as you are. If you hang on to him, you&#039;re just going to make him spill his Salisbury steak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO memorize the bus schedules and routes before making any attempt to ride anywhere. You don&#039;t want to be 45 minutes into your trip and suddenly realize you&#039;re on the number 9 <strong>B</strong>, which for some reason goes to the opposite side of town from the number 9 <strong>A</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO whatever you can to avoid taking the city bus in the future. They are universally terrible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Please understand that everything here is a joke and should not be taken seriously. - Shauvon</em></p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>Just last weekend was the annual Chicago Comics and Entertainment Expo, or C2E2. This is the second year that I&#039;ve gone, and the first year I went on a Saturday. It&#039;s a pretty exciting event, and though it costs $35 ($25 if you buy tickets ahead of time), I think it&#039;s worth it. A comic convention is a pretty interesting place. A large number of people are - for this one weekend - free to finally express their nerdy fantasies. It&#039;s the only time you can see chubby versions of your favorite movie and comic book characters. I really wish I could have gotten a costume together, because it really is a lot of fun. I did, of course, bring my camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9201.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>C2E2 takes place each year in McCormick Place, just south of downtown. Maybe it was just me, but it seemed much bigger this year. Incidentally, those serious looking guards standing to the right are just dudes in costume - unless C2E2 was being protected by S.H.I.E.L.D. this year.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9199.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The first costume we saw, though, was this positively adorable little dude walking into the convention center. Jedi? Nope, Jawa. I looked for him inside, so I could get a picture of his hood up - and buy a new protocol droid - but I couldn&#039;t find him.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9203.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>This guy is great. I enjoyed walking around with Alyson because she could point out all of the Harry Potter references and I could point out all of the Sci-Fi references (like this guy).</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9216.jpg' height='534' width='800'><div class='caption'>The place was absolutely packed. This was my view for most of it. I can&#039;t imagine how boring it must be for somebody of normal height. We tried following that Stormtrooper, thinking he would be able to clear a path, but I think it was just a guy in costume.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9260.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>I was pretty honored that people have already started Cosplaying as District Alpha characters, but Alyson told me they were just <em>Hunger Games</em> people. You still have to give them props for the timeliness of their costumes. So, in the <em>Hunger Games</em> everybody caries an expensive camera?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9261.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>Even Sith Lords have to stand in line to get an autograph from Anthony Daniels?!</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9264.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>These two dudes spent a lot of time making some Handheld Portable Portal Whatevers, but they don&#039;t even have the leg braces. Come on, guys!</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9267.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This girl and her friends just kept saying 'Abraham Lincoln. Airplane. Raincloud.' Get it!?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9268.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s a really awesome Gamorrean Guard. He barely made it inside before he was mobbed by photographers, which I guess is to be expected. I later saw him with his mask off, and he was a really sweet looking older guy with a great big bushy beard.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9272.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This old costume&#039;s still got legs.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9273.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>You really have to hand it to this guy for the sheer quality of this costume, and his absolute commitment to posing in it. What you have to hand him is, apparently, a cheeseburger.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9280.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The cool thing about a general comic convention, as opposed to a Sci-Fi or more specific type of convention, is that all bets are off when it comes to costumes. Any time period, real or imagined, is game. </div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9285.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>It&#039;s really great that dudes who bought or made Stormtrooper costumes a few years ago are getting bored with them, so they&#039;re coming up with fantastic ways to make them fresh.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9287.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This picture is great, yes, but what I love is whatever&#039;s going on between that chubby dude and the Stormtrooper.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9291.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>When you wear a costume to a convention, you&#039;re going to be in a lot of pictures - that&#039;s probably why you do it. The important thing is to really get your pose down. Everybody has their own, and it&#039;s fun to watch them strike it over and over as people all around them take pictures from every angle.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9296.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This guy was obviously extremely proud of his homemade Tron: Legacy costume. It looked great, and I&#039;m glad his girlfriend humored him and put on that little number to stand by his side. A comic book convention is a <em>drastically</em> different experience for a girl like that.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9298.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>Some costumes are always popular, like this kind of awkward example of a Joker / Harley Quinn combo. It&#039;s kind of awkward because he&#039;s a pretty great cartoon-style Joker, and she&#039;s a pretty great Video Game style Quinn. They don&#039;t really go together. This leads me to a bit of an aside. I was looking through the pictures I took last year. They mostly weren&#039;t interesting enough to post here, except for the following one:</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_6983.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>A the time I was more interested in those awesome The Monarch Henchmen, but upon looking back at this, I recognized that Joker. Either he found a much hotter girlfriend in the intervening year, or she got (justifiably) sick of wearing that ugly but thematically appropriate Harley Quinn costume. Joker needs to update his style to match. Or they could, you know, find a new costume pair already.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9305.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>That Ferrigno-era Hulk was pretty sweet. I try to get more candid shots of people in costume, which is tough with my giant camera. I think it&#039;s fun to see the Hulk looking at pictures on his friend&#039;s camera, or Batman trying to eat a soft pretzel.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9307.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This chick had some Hell of great makeup. She&#039;s going to be blue for weeks, probably.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9318.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This Catwoman was getting tons of attention everywhere she went. She was obviously loving every minute of it, because who wouldn&#039;t? When you&#039;re in a giant room full of chubby dudes, this is kind of unfair, really.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9320.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>Dr. Doom was in a big group with the Catwoman, an Ares and a lady Dr. Who. This picture shows the contrast between attention that he was getting compared to his Catwoman friend.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9341.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>If I were at a comic book convention dressed as Godzilla, I would just walk around knocking stuff over until they kicked me out. How can you not do that?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9346.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>I got the feeling that these dudes were being paid to wear those beer costumes, but they were still pretty cool.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s just a taste of the costumes that were on display. One popular costume this year was 'chick with giant hammer.' I&#039;m not sure what that was about, but I saw several seemingly normally dressed girls with big (like three foot wide) hammers walking around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a lot more cool stuff to show from C2E2 this year, though, so stay tuned!</p>\n\n",

If you&#039;re into comics, tables and tables of old comic books would be pretty exciting. To anybody else, it&#039;s pretty boring. It&#039;s best to go to an event like this with one specific thing in mind that you want to get. Otherwise you had better go with lots of cash. It can be pretty tempting to buy lots of stuff - if you&#039;re into this kind of stuff.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9208.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>However, everybody is into this stuff. If you ever have occasion to buy some Hi-Chew candy from Japan, do it. They&#039;re kind of like Starbursts, except ten times better. I bought $20 worth, because I have been dreaming of them ever since last C2E2.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9213.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The problem with nerd conventions is that there are tons of booths like this Toy Cave, but they&#039;re all clogged with nerds. You just have to resign yourself to the fact that you can&#039;t really walk through and look at everything. I tried to examine the traffic flows to figure out what works and what doesn&#039;t - in case I need to make another how-to guide - but there really is no rhyme or reason to it. You just have to move as fast as you can, and try be as small an obstruction as possible if you stop to look at a vintage toy or poster or Catwoman.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9246.jpg' height='534' width='800'><div class='caption'>The problem is that there are no organized traffic areas. In this picture, which is about as average a sight as you could find, there are people standing in every possible direction - in what should be a flowing traffic area. I get really irked by crowds not making any effort to maintain proper traffic flow patterns. I will resist the urge to get into details about the way crowds should work.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9215.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Pepsi seems to have some new version of Pepsi every time I go to a thing like this.

I would think that people who work on and ride motorcycles would shy away from things depicting mutilated corpses, but whatever. I also don&#039;t think a zombie would have the coordination to walk on stilts like this chick, but also whatever. <strong>Edit</strong> - I&#039;ve been told that this was a booth for the dungeon of doom haunted house located in Zion IL. That must be one terrifying haunted house.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9222.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>This other dude at the same booth was happy to pose for a picture holding that ax to somebody&#039;s throat. If you look carefully, you&#039;ll catch a glimpse of the booth that shared a wall with these motorcycle zombies. It was for the Bristol Renaissance Faire. It&#039;s juxtapositions like that which make these things great fun.

Debugging some MVC application? No, she&#039;s looking at a picture of . . . herself.

Last year, I was kind of freaked out by how much <em>Big Bang Theory</em> stuff there was. There was still plenty this year, but thankfully it wasn&#039;t so prevalent. Do actual nerds really watch that show, or are the BBT shirts just designed to make fun of outsiders trying to look like one of us?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/C2E2_2012/IMG_9309.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>A couple of women were selling these things really hard.

Thankfully there are enough normal people (in <em>Big Bang Theory</em> t-shirts) who kind of help bring the average BO levels up to a bearable level.

      "title": "Building a Web Server",
      "text": "\n\n<p>So it&#039;s been over two years since I started thinking about getting my very own Web Server, and almost two years since the last time I posted here about it. Needless to say, I haven&#039;t just forgotten about it in that time. Turn the way-back machine to two years ago, then...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When last I mentioned this project, I was mired in the difficult process of convincing my Internet Service Provider to get me set up with a static IP address. It started to seem like it wasn&#039;t going to work terribly well, but I decided to go ahead with the project, anyway. One glorious day, I got on the bus to head out to the local Microcenter to buy a pile of computer bits.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4763.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Microcenter: a magical place.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Microcenter is like Newegg.com, except that you don&#039;t have to wait a few days to get anything. They have almost anything you could want in the way of technology or computer bits, and for a lot of stuff their prices are actually better than online. It&#039;s a great place to go on a Saturday Morning to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Later that day, I got a bunch of dudes together to play <em>Twilight: Imperium</em>, so I&#039;m pretty sure this was the nerdiest day of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent a good while browsing the bits at Microcenter, picking out the perfect components for my new server. I decided not to go crazy and actually build a real server. That would be just too expensive and far more powerful than I needed. These days, a basic budget computer (with plenty of hard drive space) is actually perfectly capable of any average home server task. Armed with this knowledge (it was more of a hope than actual knowledge at the time), I got together parts that I hoped would be super stable, power efficient, and inexpensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efficiency is the name of the game with a server, not just in choosing the components themselves, but also in getting absolutely every unnecessary piece out of the way. Almost all desktop and laptop computers are air-cooled, so all of the components rely on fresh air moving over them to keep them from overheating (which is when things break). When building a computer, you really have to pay attention to airflow, and make sure that air can easily get from one side of the case to the other. Any wires inside the case can get in the way of that airflow, so it&#039;s best to get rid of anything you don&#039;t need. On my server, then, I wanted to get rid of everything but the bare necessities. I didn&#039;t want any removable disk drives, unnecessary power cables, or expansion cards of any sort. I knew this thing would need to be on 24/7, so it would have to be at peak form to run as long as possible without any problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4765.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I started with the case, which needed to be able to keep the thing cool and quiet through constant operation. I chose this CM Storm Scout. It&#039;s a mid-tower, so it isn&#039;t ridiculously huge, but it has plenty of fans and vents for airflow. I have a Cooler Master case for my primary PC, and it has worked very well, so I was sure this would be up to the task. Computer case boxes are always really silly. This isn&#039;t some sort of stealth bomber, it&#039;s a budget-level computer case.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4798.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s the back of the case box. Again, this isn&#039;t even a very top of the line case, so it really isn&#039;t that cool at all, even to nerds.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4766.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The power supply is perhaps the most important component, because it will need to maintain performance and efficiency while being powered on all the time. I would have loved to go with a high-end Antec or PC Power and Cooling supply, but I saved a bit of money with this Cooler Master unit. 600 Watts would be more than enough, so it won&#039;t be struggling with a lot of strain. It&#039;s also modular, which means I only have to use the wires that I need. Also, it&#039;s eXtreme, so how could it be bad?</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4773.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The hard drive(s) are perhaps the most important component, because they would need to safely and securely hold lots of important data. The best way to do things is to have the Operating System on one drive, and have another, much larger drive for storage. I had some old Seagate 320 Gigabyte SATA drives laying around, so I wanted to save money by using one of those for the Operating System.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4767.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I did not want to cut corners with the storage drive, though, so I bought these Western Digital one terrabyte drives. I&#039;ve had nothing but the best experiences with Western Digital in the past, so I knew I could trust these. Yes, I bought two of them, so I could put them in a mirrored RAID array.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Drives, takes multiple hard drives and through the power of magic turns them into much more powerful drives. In striped mode, the two drives get turned into one super fast drive with the capacity of both smaller drives put together. It&#039;s super fast that way, but also really dangerous because if one drive fails, you lose all your data. In mirrored mode, any data written to the array is identically saved to both drives. It&#039;s not any faster than a single drive, and you have to pay for two drives to get the capacity of one, but it&#039;s super safe. Modern Hard Drives rely on lots of mechanical do-dads that can go catastrophically wrong at any moment, and if they do, any data on the drive is unceremoniously destroyed. If you mirror the drive, though, one of the drives can fail and the other will still have the data. Getting a mirrored RAID array is the best way to cover my butt in the event of hardware failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4768.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The motherboard is perhaps the most important component, because it needs to have a lot of the features I need while being super stable. I always go with ASUS components where possible, and every time I&#039;ve gotten a motherboard by another company I&#039;ve regretted it. This particular board has built-in video (so I wouldn&#039;t need a separate video card), built-in RAID (so I wouldn&#039;t need a separate RAID card), and it&#039;s one of the first motherboards to have onboard USB 3, which will come in handy in the future, I&#039;m sure. Also, it has xtreme design, so it should go with the power supply I picked out.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4769.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I went to Cooler Master, once again, for the CPU heatsink. They make really dependable cooling products, and I really needed something I could depend on for the CPU heatsink, which is probably the most important component of the entire system. The processor needs to run constantly at peak efficiency without overheating, so by using a heatsink that would be perfectly suited to a processor much more powerful than the one I chose, I shouldn&#039;t have any problems.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4770.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I cut a bit of a corner with the RAM, I&#039;ll admit it. I would have loved to use some RAM I had laying around (with those hard drives), but the motherboard and processor I chose needed DDR 3, so I had to get some new stuff. Though I went with a cheap option, I didn&#039;t get a cheap-o brand. I got a mid-spec 4GB kit, with two 2GB modules. I figured that if I decided the server needed some more RAM, I could always just get another one (the motherboard supports four modules), and bring the capacity up to 8 GB.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4771.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>So here&#039;s the processor I&#039;ve told you so much about. Honestly, I wasn&#039;t as concerned about the CPU as I was about some of the other bits, so I made my choice based on price and potential heat. I went with a dual-core, figuring that a quad would just be unnecessary for these purposes. Getting a processor that was too powerful would only use more electricity and generate more heat inside the case. I went with AMD because Phenom processors are way cheaper than their Intel counterparts, and by getting a Black Edition I could control the clock speed myself. Usually this means you can overclock the processor to get a bit more power out of it, but I actually wanted to underclock it. That way it would be extra stable, cool, and efficient.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, the whole thing cost about $800. Quite a mini-Christmas, indeed. Speccing out the parts on Newegg came out to about the same amount, so I was pretty content with my decision to buy it at Microcenter. The bus ride home wasn&#039;t the most comfortable in the world, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Computer Porn: Putting the Bits Together</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4775.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s the case out of its silly box. Aesthetics were totally unimportant, because this will probably just live in a closet or something, but this case has a few features I like. Having a window might seem like a really stupid thing, but it&#039;s actually really handy for quickly glancing at the inside of the case. You can see if there&#039;s a lot of dust on the CPU heatsink (which is really bad for airflow), or quickly see if anything is amiss. I also really like how the handle / style whatever business up top shelters the fan on top of the case. I can set things on top of the case and it won&#039;t obstruct air flow to the important top fan.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4779.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Here&#039;s a closeup of the heatsink on the motherboard chipset. Whatever, ASUS.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4782.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Those square things in front of that dumb heatsink structure are solid-state capacitors, which run much more efficiently and with a much lower failure rate than the standard cylindrical type capacitors. They&#039;re pretty much standard on ASUS motherboards these days, but it&#039;s yet another component increasing the efficiency of this machine.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4791.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Another cool feature of the motherboard was these little switches, which let you toggle the CPU overclocking. It&#039;s a feature you may never need, but the one moment you do could mean the difference between a computer that works and one that doesn&#039;t, so it&#039;s good to have. The little button lets you turn the computer on without it even being inside a case, which can be handy for debugging purposes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4794.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>This is the CPU, sitting upside-down on its box. When I got it out, I realized with horror that one of the pins was ever so slightly bent. You can just barely see it toward the right side of the array of pins. This could have meant disaster for the build, because I&#039;m pretty sure all those pins are important. The cool thing about buying this stuff in a store was that I could easily return or exchange it if anything was broken, which is a time consuming process with Newegg.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4797.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I ever so carefully bent the pin back to vertical with the end of a flathead screwdriver. Back in the day, Processors didn&#039;t come with these big aluminum heat spreaders on top, and you could actually see the processor die and some other bits on top. It&#039;s much easier to install a heatsink now, though, which is why they do it this way.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4801.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>To judge the efficiency of a heatsink, you can look at the bottom of it, where it contacts the processor. The more polished the bottom - and if it&#039;s made of more conductive copper instead of aluminum - the better it is. This little thing needs to make as perfect a seal with the processor as possible, to transfer as much of the heat away as it can. You should also, of course, use a quality thermal paste.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/webserver_construction/IMG_4803.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>And then after some stuff happened, the computer was done. I guess I didn&#039;t feel like taking pictures of the actual process. I really need to get my standards higher. Anyway, here&#039;s the server sitting next to my computer. Don&#039;t let the relative size of this thing fool you, it&#039;s actually pretty big - it&#039;s just that my computer is ridiculously huge. As you can kind of see through the window, there&#039;s only really one bundle of wires going through the interior of the case - the 12 volt connector which goes straight to the middle of the motherboard. There&#039;s no video card, no CD drive, and only a few tiny SATA connectors going to the hard drives.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So for about $800, I built myself a pretty decent home server. Only time would tell how good it would be at actually doing server tasks, but that&#039;s all part of the adventure. Next - probably in about two years - I&#039;ll show how the machine is set up on the software side of things, and then we can get into what I&#039;ve actually used this thing for.</p>\n\n",

Why, all sorts of great, exciting, and broadening work around the office. We have lots of organizing to be done here! Sorting stuff out - you&rsquo;ll be an expert in no time. Collating? Yeah, you&rsquo;ll do some collating. We need somebody switch out our Futurama DVD&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ve watched all of the episodes on them. Also, come to think of it, you would be responsible for bringing us coffee. I mean, just thinking out loud, really. DenyConformity.com Interns will do all kinds of cool stuff, in addition to the coffee thing which I just thought of on the spot. Coffee is just a part of the job. Everybody keeps talking about coffee - that&rsquo;s why I bring it up - and we are totally just as much into coffee as every other productive adult. That&rsquo;s why we need an Intern. Some people have never really had much coffee before, I guess, so they aren&rsquo;t sure what the big deal is - but not me! I&rsquo;m all about coffee, yessir. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, please note that we will not be calling our interns &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; You will be calling me &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; I just want to be clear on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking to hire up to one intern for the Fall 2012 semester, to start immediately. We have only one position available, so get your applications in today! While you&rsquo;re at it, If you stop by to drop off your application in person, you might as well bring me a coffee. I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to be in the area anyway. Any kind is fine. Obviously, I know what kind of coffee somebody would bring a guy, but I want to see if you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicant must be a go-getter, because they&rsquo;ll be go-getting a lot of stuff. Self starters need not apply; it makes me uncomfortable when things start themselves. Forward thinkers are much preferred over those for whom time is not linear. I&rsquo;ll give perfectionists a try, because it takes balls to lie so blatantly to somebody&rsquo;s face. If you&rsquo;re physically weak, that&rsquo;s pretty great, because one of your duties will be to lose to me at arm wrestling, anyway. Applicant must be capable of laughing at jokes they don&rsquo;t find funny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowledge of Team Fortress 2 is a plus. Applicant must own his or her own computer capable of playing Team Fortress 2. Applicant should not be obnoxiously good at Team Fortress 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need someone with Ruby or Flash experience. We don&rsquo;t need someone with teaching experience. We don&rsquo;t need someone with travel experience. We don&rsquo;t need someone with driving experience. I can&rsquo;t have somebody around here making me look bad. If you think you&rsquo;re here to show how good you are at stuff I don&rsquo;t know you can just get the Hell out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An applicant needs enough proficiency with web design paradigms that they can keep up a conversation about it, but still be inexperienced enough to be able to think I&rsquo;m really cool for being able to do stuff. In fact, a strong proficiency in anything is only going to make you seem like you&rsquo;re trying too hard. Be good enough to get something hacked together, not so good that people would be like, &ldquo;jeez, look at that show-off.&rdquo; This is, of course, unless you&rsquo;re really good at making coffee. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bring to your interview between three and five good ideas for stuff to write about on the Internet. It&rsquo;s probably best if you aren&rsquo;t too terribly attached to them. Also, we&rsquo;ll need some references on your coffee making ability, preferably from anybody who really didn&rsquo;t like coffee until you made it for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please be prepared to answer the following questions at your interview:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &ldquo;What would you say is your strongest?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &ldquo;How long did you stay in your last position (before you got tired)?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &ldquo;Why or how did you choose to wear that particular shirt today?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will not ask you any of these questions in the Interview, but if you aren&rsquo;t prepared for them, we will know. Bring a couple copies of your resume, and seven references - Star Wars, not professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After extensive negotiations with local Universities, we can now officially provide you with class credit in &ldquo;please stop contacting us.&rdquo; You will have to deal with the paperwork yourself, though, because they aren&rsquo;t returning my calls anymore. I&rsquo;m not sure how many credit hours we&rsquo;re talking about, here, but you&rsquo;ll be doing stuff for me every day. Just in one semester we&rsquo;re looking at several hundred hours. I mean, every day you&rsquo;ll at least be working long enough to make some coffee. That&rsquo;s like - what - two, three hours a day?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, this is an unpaid internship only - sorry. If hired, however, you will be able to dig through one of two sacks of cables and take whatever you want. Actually, if you know anybody who would want a sack or two of cables, let me know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either email your applications to internship@denyconformity.com, or send them directly to:</p>\r\n<p>Back window,</p>\r\n<p>1983 Honda Civic parked outside Daley Plaza</p>\r\n<p>Chicago, IL 60602</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the one with the &ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; bumper sticker</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Respond to the following prompts, in as many words as you see fit:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nName:<br>\r\nEmail address:<br>\r\nCut of beef (Flank, ground, etc):<br>\r\nLast 4 digits of a number you made up:<br>\r\nPreferred occupation:<br>\r\nSchool of attendance:<br>\r\nPerfect Sunday:<br>\r\nOne thing you wish you could take back:<br>\r\nOne thing you wish you could take forward:<br>\r\nCoffee making proficiency (1 - 5, 5 being &ldquo;really great&rdquo;):<br>\r\nCoffee making experience (1 - 5, 5 being &ldquo;never done it&rdquo;):<br>\r\nSuggestions for making good Coffee:<br>\r\nThank you:\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Please rate the following sentences based on how much you agree with them (1 is &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; and 5 is &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo;):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n&ldquo;I really enjoy coffee.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I would rather make coffee for others than drink it myself.&rdquo;<br>\r\n&ldquo;I often find myself fantasizing about ways to improve how I make coffee.&rdquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, please sign (and print) your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, students, for taking the time to apply, and good luck!</p>\n\n",

      "title": "DenyConformity.com Redesign Journal part 4",
      "text": "\n\n<p>This is part three (well, technically part four) of an ongoing series about the redesign of this website. Spoiler alert: the new design has been live for three weeks. I originally meant for this ongoing thing to actually go on as I was working on the new site and be sort of a teaser for the new design. Now that the new design is live, though, this will just have to serve as more of an ongoing discussion. Think of it as the audio commentary track for the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far in these posts I have talked about the way the site came about, and some of the quirks and problems in the old design. Today I want to discuss some of my thoughts on Web Theory. Just what is the Internet? What is a website? What is DenyConformity.com, and how does it fit into the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/design_journal_4/oldsite.PNG' height='674' width='1344'><div class='caption'>The old (not the old-old, but the new-old) version of this site.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>One major problem with the Internet is its lack of tangibility. We know what a book is and a magazine makes perfect sense, but what is a website? Books, magazines, and other more physical things are limited by the nature of what they are. For example, a book has text on pages, magazines are a certain size, and a TV show has a pretty specific box (figuratively and literaly) that it has to fit in. A website doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to conform to (hey, that&rsquo;s like the name of this site!). There&rsquo;s no limit to the design, content, platform, format, or audience that a website can have. Yes, that&rsquo;s what makes the Internet great, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that we need better terms. We can&rsquo;t just call something a website just like you can&rsquo;t go around bragging about your classic muscle car by telling people you have a &ldquo;vehicle.&rdquo; Think about everything that counts as a website. That old Hanson fan page from 1997 is a website. Homestarrunner.com is a website. Google Docs is a website. Facebook is a website. Engadget is a website. Is there anything that is common between any of those things, aside from some underlying technology and the fact that they all run in a web browser?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/design_journal_4/hanson.PNG' height='671' width='1340'><div class='caption'>We are going to leave this page up, but stop working on it. The run-off of this page is Hanson Heaven! it will be updated as often as possible. Come and visit! (<a href='http://jenilynn.tripod.com/' target='_blank'>jenilynn.tripod.com</a>)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We have different kinds of websites, then. Google Docs is a web application. Facebook is a social network. Engadget is a technology news blog. We have a whole new vocabulary to describe all this stuff. It just isn&rsquo;t enough, though. Go to your parents and try to explain to them what Homestar Runner is - or Twitter, or Tumblr - in a way that isn&rsquo;t essentially just saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a really interesting website place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet is almost by definition a lack of format. Is it even possible, then, to come up with terminology to describe what we do with it? More importantly, does it even matter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet doesn&rsquo;t operate like any other medium. It&rsquo;s not like a library, where you browse through great shelves of content. You don&rsquo;t just go to Internet and click on Interesting Website Place. It&rsquo;s like a vast, featureless subdivision, where every house looks the same from the outside, and you can&rsquo;t walk in any front doors. The only way into a house is by going through another house. You don&rsquo;t just walk up to a website, you have to be sent there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did you get to this page? Did you click a link on Facebook or Twitter? Did you stumble upon this page? Did you come here from the RSS feed or the main timeline? How many of you typed &ldquo;http://www.denyconformity.com/post/389/Design_Journal_4&rdquo; into your browser? Certainly very few, if anybody did that. Even the most pure type of traffic - those people who hear about this site and type DenyConformity.com into their address bar - are still only going here because they&rsquo;ve heard about the site from some other source. No traffic on the Internet is original - it&rsquo;s all second-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of this, the concept of location doesn&rsquo;t matter on the Internet anymore. Your browser&rsquo;s address bar is becoming less and less necessary - a vestigial organ which only exists to comfort our need for a physical metaphor. Look at Google Chrome, where the address bar isn&rsquo;t really an address bar anymore. It&rsquo;s a search bar, where you can just type &ldquo;interesting website place&rdquo; and then you get Google links to anywhere you might want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who cares what a website is? It doesn&rsquo;t matter what DenyConformity.com is, because all that matters is the content. The biggest surge of traffic I&rsquo;ve gotten since the new site went live was last weekend, when somebody posted a picture from my &ldquo;How to Ride a Bus&rdquo; guide on their Tumblr page. There was no &ldquo;check out this interesting website place.&rdquo; There was just a link, and that link went right to a particular piece of content. People read that content, and then they continued on to some other link to some other piece of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I see it, there are three types of websites. There are the sites I use (Google Docs, for example), there are the sites I watch (stuff like Facebook or email, which I regularly check for updates), and there are the sites I <em>consume</em>. I&rsquo;ll read an article here or watch a funny video there. DenyConformity.com is that kind of website - a thing to be consumed. It&rsquo;s the magazine you pick up while waiting for an appointment. It&rsquo;s the book you read while you&rsquo;re on the bus. It&rsquo;s the art you hang on your wall. DenyConformity.com is here for you to take in. That&rsquo;s all. Maybe it will enlighten you, or maybe it will make you laugh, but it has only one goal: to be interesting. All I deliver is regular content that I find interesting, and that&rsquo;s exactly what DenyConformity.com is here for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s why I just call DenyConformity.com &ldquo;a really interesting website place.&rdquo;</p>\n\n",

      "title": "A Zebra Three-Way",
      "text": "\n\n<p>A(nother) Pen Review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that everybody should have one good pen. You should keep a dependable ballpoint in your pocket for situations when you need to jot down some notes or sign a receipt. It&rsquo;s as necessary, I feel, as your wallet and keys. Through most of my college career, for me that pen was a Zebra F-402. They come in a two-pack, which is customary at Zebra. I&rsquo;m not sure where the first one ended up, lost to the annals of time. The other stuck with me through quite a few adventures, until just a few months ago when I let somebody borrow it. If you take nothing else away from this post, you should at least learn that if you have a pen you like, you should never let somebody borrow it. Needless to say, that old dependable 402 and I will never cross paths again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, I was out at the grocery store, and I passed one of those office supply stores - I think it was a Paperclipz (the z in their logo is a paperclip!). After using this Parker Jotter for a few weeks, I figured I might as well get some new pens to have something to officially compare it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/IMG_9378.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I got a whole herd of Zebras.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I won&rsquo;t go into a bunch of detail about who Zebra is, because it&rsquo;s not as interesting as Parker (the company). They&rsquo;re a division of another company called Zebra, which is probably a division of another company called Zebra. Zebra (one of them, anyway) makes a bunch of different products, like toner and markers. Basically, if it can totally ruin your Mom&rsquo;s towels, they make it. Zebra has been around since 1982, so they don&rsquo;t have quite the same legacy as Parker (the legacy), but they were founded as an already wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation, so they at least haven&rsquo;t lost any legacy, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zebra makes a pen called the F-301, which which has the awkwardly ambiguous nickname, &ldquo;The Original.&rdquo; It can&rsquo;t be the original retractable ballpoint pen, because Parker was making them for decades before Zebra (any of them) existed. It can&rsquo;t even be Zebra&rsquo;s original pen, because why would they have called it the 301?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, Zebra specializes in stainless steel bodied ballpoints and Mechanical Pencils. I&rsquo;m focusing on their main fleet of ballpoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Welcome to Pens-ilvania</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/IMG_9379.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Today&rsquo;s subjects: &ldquo;The Original&rdquo; F-301, &ldquo;The Gel&rdquo; G-301, and &ldquo;The Aforesaid&rdquo; F-402.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with Zebra is that I&rsquo;m not sure why they have a &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; of ballpoints. Ballpoints are workhorses, purely for taking down notes or writing checks. They lack the smooth uninterrupted lines of felt-tips, the fine, even points of rollerballs, and the visceral grace of fountains. Everybody needs a ballpoint, but you only need one. Why, then, does Zebra have an entire line of them? Where is the market for all of these things?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zebra has the original 301, the nicer 402, and then the unnecessarily expensive 701. I&rsquo;m skipping the 701, because I&rsquo;m not part of the 1%, but the others are too similar to both exist. They&rsquo;re both stainless steel, and they have exactly the same ink and cartridge (so on paper they&rsquo;re identical). Is the 301 for the ever-so-slightly less wealthy? Do people buying pens think they don&rsquo;t deserve a 402? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, for numerous reasons, there&rsquo;s no reason to ever consider an F-301 at all. I won&rsquo;t waste too much time analyzing it. It&rsquo;s the bad kind of light, where it just feels cheap. The textured plastic grip is uncomfortable, and the click action is perfectly generic. At the Paperclipz, a pair of 301s was only $1.20 cheaper than a pair of 402s. Just get a medium fries with lunch, and get the 402.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/IMG_9388.jpg' height='438' width='800'><div class='caption'>The F-402 isn&rsquo;t usually this out of focus.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 402 is a much better pen. It&rsquo;s heavier than the 301 (or a Jotter), so it feels more substantial. It doesn&rsquo;t have any subtle curves (or the pretentious arrow clip), and even in spite of that huge rubber grip it&rsquo;s pretty spartan. It&rsquo;s a no nonsense writing utensil, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. It&rsquo;s probably because I used one for so long, but it&rsquo;s more comfortable to me than the Parker. That shouldn&rsquo;t matter to you, because that&rsquo;s purely an opinion and there&rsquo;s no reason for you to be subject to mine. Still, it&rsquo;s worth noting that when I go to grab a pen in the morning, of these four (including the Parker), I seem to always go for the 402. The 402&rsquo;s action is somewhere between the chincy click of the 301 and the heavy &ldquo;cachunk&rdquo; of the Jotter. It&rsquo;s not as satisfying as the Jotter, but I feel more comfortable clicking the 402 because I&rsquo;m not afraid it will wake up my neighbors.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/IMG_9389.jpg' height='372' width='800'><div class='caption'>Just imagine it without the &ldquo;gel&rdquo; icon, and this picture can also be for the F-301.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The other pen I picked up looks just like the 301. Okay, so it is a 301, but this one has a G instead of an F. I&rsquo;m not sure what the F stands for, but the G apparently stands for &ldquo;Gel.&rdquo; It has an identical body to the 301, and other than the &ldquo;gel&rdquo; badge, they&rsquo;re completely indistinguishable. That&rsquo;s a mark against the G-301. Everything I said about the F-301 is true about the G-301, except that since the G-301 has slightly different internal mechanisms, its action feels even more chincy. Also, the G-301 was only $4.99 at Paperclipz, which is yet another reason why you should never buy an F-301.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The 10th Circle of Gel</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to pick up a gel pen, not just because somebody recommended the G-301, but because gel is pretty popular and I wanted to do a side-by-side comparison to regular ink. The differences are quite interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gel ink has a few unique properties. It&rsquo;s water-based, as opposed to the dye-alcohol paste in standard ballpoints. This means it&rsquo;s actually more environmentally friendly than standard ink. You would think this would be more common knowledge, since everybody is obsessed with the environment these days. Because of how gel works, you can get a wide range of wacky colors, which is why you can buy hot pink and electric yellow gel pens. Gel ink is more opaque than regular ink, which makes it thicker and darker, and it can supposedly be used on a wider range of mediums - including stuff that isn&rsquo;t absorbent, like paper or your Mom&rsquo;s towels. Gel ink will take longer to fade than regular ink, so if you want to sign some official documents or do some other sort of archival thing, you should use gel. Gel will not, however, last as long in a pen, because it is less efficient than standard ink. You might need to buy as many as eight refills to the G-301 to keep up with a single F-301 cartridge. Gel supposedly also will &ldquo;clump&rdquo; more and cause breaks in your lines, since the gel doesn&rsquo;t coat the titular ball as evenly as standard ink will. Finally, gel uses something called a liquid stopper, which can evaporate. When it does, there&rsquo;s nothing keeping the gel inside anymore, and it will get all over your mom&rsquo;s towels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some other more technical things about gel, but those are the basics. How does it compare in the real world, though?</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Write Stuff</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>In the world of pens, ballpoints are the blue collar workers. They can&rsquo;t be expected to do anything but the most basic of pen on paper action. That&rsquo;s not to say they aren&rsquo;t good for anything, just that they&rsquo;re never going to be held in as high regard as felt for artists or fountains for writers. Because of this, ballpoint pens have some important features that make them special. Generally you can be pretty cruel to the tip of a ballpoint, and it won&rsquo;t be destroyed as easily as a felt-tip or a fountain nib. They&rsquo;re perfectly suited to hang out in your pocket, waiting for their time to be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did a series of tests to compare the strengths of these ballpoint pens, on standard college-ruled paper - I figure it&rsquo;s a pretty common media for ballpoints. I then scanned the pages for analysis. These tests are by no means scientific, but I hope they will be a reasonable facsimile of real-world anecdotal evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first test I looked at was a fill test. I wanted to see how well the ink would fill an area, and how it would look afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/1.jpg' height='229' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 1: the Fill Test</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, the F-301 and the F-402 have the exact same ink, so they should be pretty identical here. Interestingly, the Parker ink seems nicer to my naked and admittedly inexperienced eye. It&rsquo;s a warmer black, and it has a better sheen to it. Here you can see the higher opacity of the gel ink showing its colors (literally).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a similar test, I ran the pens over a fill made by another pen.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/2.jpg' height='543' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 2: The Overlap Test</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 402 and 301 blend together here, which is to be expected. However, you can see how the warmer Parker ink shows up on top of the Zebra ink. The gel is again a darker and more solid color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next was a far more important test - the smear test. As a left-handed writer, smearing is an eternal problem for me. I want a brand of ink that will smear the least as I&rsquo;m taking notes in my various notepads and journals. I drew a thick swatch and smeared it with my thumb, and then did the same with a single line. Then I drew a line and counted to five before smearing it, to see how quickly the ink dries.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/3.jpg' height='609' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 3: the Smear Test</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The gel suddenly loses its appeal. Since it&rsquo;s water-based, it smears much more readily than regular ink. You can see how the gel &ldquo;globbed&rdquo; at the end of the last line. A bit more ink was absorbed into the page at the end of the line, where I stopped writing. The other three pens seem pretty similar, but thanks to the power of computers I could get a bit more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/4.jpg' height='609' width='800'><div class='caption'>Smear Test modified in Photoshop</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite interesting. Here you can see just how thoroughly each line is smeared. The Jotter seems to smear just a tiny bit more than the Zebra ink. The 402 also seems to be a tiny bit more smeared than the 301. This might simply be due to tiny differences in the pressure I used to write them. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to assume that the rubber grip gave me a tiny bit more power in the 402.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how the smears are kind of striped. Either the smear streaks are a result of an irregularity in the pens&rsquo; balls, or it&rsquo;s the pattern of my thumbprint. Remember how I said this wouldn&rsquo;t be scientific?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important thing about a pen is how much pressure you need to write. This is where ballpoints have a disadvantage, because you actually need a lot of pressure to get the ball rolling, as it were (and it is). With all ballpoint pens, there&rsquo;s a sweet spot, where you get a good distribution of ink. Press too softly and you won&rsquo;t get anything, but press too hard and you&rsquo;ll have an ugly, broken line.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/5.jpg' height='348' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 4: Heavy Writing</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had any budget at all, I might build some sort of robot that is able to write things at exact pressures. I don&rsquo;t have a budget, though, so I didn&rsquo;t do that. Instead, I just wrote a thing with each pen, pressing very hard. This was harder than anybody would ever comfortably write - except maybe the Hulk or something. At this level, all four pens heavily exhibited what I call &ldquo;Mosesing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/diagram_good.jpg' height='600' width='800'><div class='caption'>This is how a ballpoint pen is supposed to work. Basically.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I threw together a couple diagrams to explain this visually. Above is an example of how a ballpoint pen is supposed to work. Ink (in this case it&rsquo;s hot pink) flows over the ball and makes a smooth, even mark on the page. However, that&rsquo;s not how it works all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/diagram_bad.jpg' height='600' width='800'><div class='caption'>This is how a ballpoint pen actually works.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, especially when you press too hard, the ball is smushed into the page, and ink doesn&rsquo;t fit underneath it. Then you get a line with an odd stripe in the middle, which you can only really notice if you look closely. I call it &ldquo;Mosesing&rdquo; because the ball is like a tiny little Moses parting the ink like a tiny Red (or pink) Sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This happens with all ballpoint pens, and it&rsquo;s why they aren&rsquo;t great for anything that needs to look nice. Here you can see it happening randomly with all four pens, even when just writing normally.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/9.jpg' height='243' width='800'><div class='caption'>When people see your uneven lines, they&rsquo;ll know that you have a Parker.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/8.jpg' height='334' width='1132'><div class='caption'>The F-301 and the F-402 have the same ink, so they&rsquo;re both equally guilty.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/7.jpg' height='325' width='800'><div class='caption'>The gel ink has it the worst.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gel is more viscous than normal ink, so it gets the worst Mosesing. The line drawn by the G-301 is about twice as wide as the line drawn by the F-301, and their tips are the same size. That&rsquo;s why the gel ink runs out faster, and it&rsquo;s twice the surface area to be &ldquo;Mosesed&rdquo; by the pressure of the ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also wanted to see how the pens handled writing softly. This is an aspect where ballpoints really can&rsquo;t hold up, because they rely on the friction of the ball on the paper to get it all to work. However, I was pretty surprised by how well they hung on. This is something that would have been more of a challenge for pens back in the days when Tungsten Carbide was just a wild fever dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/6.jpg' height='434' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 5: Light Writing</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There was hardly any Mosesing anymore, but the gel showed a new problem. It could not handle the lack of pressure. In all, I think the Jotter shows the most range of pressure, which translates to a higher chance that you&rsquo;ll be able to write however you&rsquo;re comfortable without having to adjust to what the pen needs. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone in picking up a foreign pen for whatever reason only to find that it requires an amount of pressure that I&rsquo;m just not used to using. That&rsquo;s a feature you don&rsquo;t want in your trusty pocket workhorse.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/10.jpg' height='243' width='800'><div class='caption'>Test 6: Extremely Low Pressure</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For the final test, I held a single sheet of paper by one end, bending it slightly to get it to stand out. I then tried my best to write a few lines on the far margin, where the pen would be able to apply very little pressure. This would really test the limits of the pens&rsquo; ability to write without much force. The three standard ink pens were able to just get some faint lines. However, the G-301 just wouldn&rsquo;t work, and mainly just managed to scrape the paper a bit. What lines the gel ink was able to make were much darker than the other pens, of course, but the plain fact is that the gel ink requires a bit more pressure to work - and with pressure comes Moses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally the Finale</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/zebra_threeway/IMG_9385.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The Zebra fleet - minus the pen for rich people.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So just how does the Zebra fleet stand up against the Jotter? First off, just forget the G-301 exists. I hate it. The 402 certainly offers some serious competition, and it might very well be a full-on toss up between it and the Jotter. Parker (the company) does have slightly better ink, and you cannot beat the build quality and elegance of the Jotter. However, the 402 is mighty comfortable, and it&rsquo;s less than half the cost (per pen) than the Jotter - plus you get an extra 402 to let somebody borrow. Purely on the merit of the pens, though, I think I actually prefer the lighter, smoother, more stylish Jotter - despite my long relationship with the 402.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlier is the G-301, with it&rsquo;s crazy gel ink. Some might really appreciate the dark, thick lines that gel gives you. Others will be put off by the higher pressure required and the fact that gel ink smears much, much more. Even if you love gel ink, though, you&rsquo;ll still be stuck with the 301 body, which basically made my hand almost fall off I hated it so much. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I ventured into hyperbole at some point there. The point is that you can get a much better gel pen than the G-301. For example, Parker makes a gel refill for the Jotter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So ultimately we can disregard most of Zebra&rsquo;s lineup. The 301 is too cheap, the 701 is too expensive, and their gel ink is in the wrong pen. They have too many pens. Like everybody else, Zebra does not need a fleet of ballpoint pens. They only need one good dependable workhorse. Unfortunately for Zebra, though, they can&rsquo;t do what the rest of us do. We already have one good pen, and it&rsquo;s made by Parker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Some of the handwriting examples were written by Alyson)</em></p>\n\n",

      "title": "A Treatise on Evil",
      "text": "\n\n<p>While dealing with the amoral practices of the utility companies, as we all do once a month, I started thinking, as I do every month, about the existence of evil. We have to live under the yolk of the power company (among other amoral authorities), forced to pay any fees and put up with uncaring service because we have no power - literally and figuratively - to stop them. It is easy to feel victimized and violated by these obvious corruptions of authority. We can easily travel down a dark road of cynicism, losing all faith in Humanity or Society. However, something dawned on me today that gave me real hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a living thing - weak, soft, and defenseless - your imperative, ultimately, is to make it to your next dinner. You personally must survive to eat dinner tonight, but you must also see that descendents of your species will live to see dinner tomorrow. What is the purpose of a life? Is there any higher purpose than to merely survive? Humans - at least this modern Society of Humans - are above that type of thinking. Dinner tonight will be provided for us. We can spend the few hours until then watching TV or deciding which tablet to buy. Is our obsession with celebrity and useless technology throwing our purpose away? I present to you that our purpose has already been lost, not because we lost our way in a sea of iPhones and Kardashians, but because we are on the cusp of a new Era of Humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is high language, I grant you, and you might think that it borders on new-age radical nonsense, but I&rsquo;m actually quite serious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of Your Earth Years ago, Humans were still animals. They fought, killed, and huddled together in caves to survive. They were weak, soft, defenseless creatures in a vastly hostile world, simply trying to live to see - and catch - dinner. However, Humans had an advantage: reason. They made tools, clothing, and shelter. They domesticated beasts and conquered agriculture. Early Humans were able to adapt so much more quickly than any other living thing. In what is cosmically a microscopic amount of time, we have grown more powerful than everything around us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, we won. We beat nature. Yes, we&rsquo;re still victims to disease and famine and natural disasters, but none of those things threaten our survival any more than buying a gallon of milk threatens someone&rsquo;s bank account. In modern society, we don&rsquo;t have to fight and struggle to see dinner. We have to find something to watch on TV while we wait for dinner to be delivered. No other species in our experience even comes close to pursuing activities that serve no purpose but to occupy the time of the pursuer. What are the Kardashians if not a complete and total admission - dare I say it, celebration - of our victory over survival?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem, though, is that we are still animals. We are the same creatures that huddled in caves thousands of years ago, and we have the same instincts to survive. When given the choice, we will take advantage of others to help ourselves. Can you blame the power company or other corporations for ruining lives to make a profit? Deep down, our CEOs are just weak, soft, defenseless creatures letting a cruel beast eat someone else instead of themselves. This is instinctual; built into our being at a primal level. You are not free of blame. As you sit there, a Human Being just as intelligent and logical as you is starving to death. Is your passive evil - cruelty of inaction - any better than a corrupt CEOs active evil - cruelty of action? Is it all simply the circle of life - survival of the fittest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans have always been brutal, pitiless creatures. Humans have always fought and killed each other to get a better piece of the world for themselves. There is no era of Human History in which some entity or group was not trying to destroy another to take what they had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen - er, Read: until recently, active evil was normal. Humans were content to commit intensely cruel actions against each other as a matter of course. It has only been recently that we have even considered the existence passive evil. Nobody in modern Society two hundred years ago would have felt bad eating a full meal when impoverished third worlds were starving around the globe. Today, active cruelty is still common, but the key is that it isn&rsquo;t universal anymore. At this rate, tomorrow it may be gone entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evil is vestigial. Its is an unnecessary organ - an evolutionary leftover - that we are slowly working to remove. Cruelty and greed is rampant in our society, yes, but they are dying. We are beginning to agree with each other on a global scale. We connect to each other through mind-boggling technology and are truly beginning to see ourselves as a unified species. There are parts of the world now which are legitimately, completely, safe. We are redefining what is right and wrong, and more importantly we are doing it based on a common morality, not supposed divine right. We don&rsquo;t seek the directives of our leaders - we make decisions for ourselves. We are rooting out those aspects of ourselves that are base and evil, and we are slowly smothering them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two hundred years ago, Humans fought world wars on the whims of Kings and Emperors. Plagues ran rampant in the streets, completely untreatable. Cruelty went unmatched. News would take weeks, if not months, to travel short distances. Just imagine how far we have progressed as a species in two hundred years. Where will we be two hundred years from now? What glorious achievements of reason and morality will we see?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine how exciting it is to be able to live in this period of history! We are witnessing the death of evil first hand, and these corrupt companies and greedy CEOs are its death knell. My grandchildren might grow up in a world where things like War, Poverty, and even Disease are nothing more than stories. This isn&rsquo;t the wild dreams of new-age radical nonsense, either. This is really happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the purpose of a life now? What will my grandchildren live for? When a species defeats survival, what is left for them to do? That, my friends, is the great question of our age. That is the new era of Humanity that we are on the cusp of discovering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Humans have finished our dinner. All we have to do now is find our dessert.</p>\n\n",

Go kill three wolves ten miles away and then come back here. Thanks!</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Note: I didn&rsquo;t want to dig through a bunch of old games to get screenshots, or deal with Google Image Search to find them, so all of the pictures in this post are artist renderings.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend and colleague Will Hughes maintains an interesting website place, where he often posts commentary on the video game industry. He posted some postings about open world games recently, and that inspired me to collect some of my similar thoughts into some postings of my own. And lo, that is what I have done. Please visit his website place to read his comments on <a href='http://amalgamatedwittering.blogspot.com/2012/03/over-flagpole-escape-as-art.html'>&ldquo;Escape as Art,&rdquo;</a> on the illusion of choice in open worlds, and <a href='http://amalgamatedwittering.blogspot.com/2012/03/off-script-problem-with-storytelling-in.html'>&ldquo;Off the Script,&rdquo;</a> on problems inherent in storytelling for open world games. Those are both very important points about this trend we&rsquo;re being force fed more and more. I agree with Hughes that merely making a game &ldquo;open world&rdquo; does not suddenly catapult it into an upper echelon of brilliant gameplay. Really, it just wastes your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in High School, I played a lot of video games. I really enjoyed shooting games like <em>Half Life</em> and <em>Unreal</em>, strategy games like <em>Command and Conquer</em>, and role playing games, like <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Then a friend introduced me to a game called <em>Gothic</em>, which was a pretty unique (at least to me at the time) open world role playing game with a fantasy / medieval theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/gothic.jpg' height='916' width='800'><div class='caption'>And terrible voice acting.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to get back into <em>Gothic</em> a few months ago, after getting the entire <em>Gothic</em> collection (they&rsquo;re up to <em>Gothic 4</em>) on Steam. It was difficult to get back into. The controls, by today&rsquo;s standard, are just weird, and though you can get over the graphics (which weren&rsquo;t great even back then), the voice acting really is hard to get around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot can be said about <em>Gothic</em>, really. It actually had surprisingly similar features to <em>Skyrim</em>, which came out ten years later. I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that <em>Gothic</em> is better than, or even really as good as <em>Skyrim</em>. I&rsquo;m also not going to belay the point, because analyzing <em>Gothic</em> is outside the scope of this posting. The point is that <em>Gothic</em> was a lot of fun, and it sucked me into the world of role playing games - a world with gems like <em>Morrowind</em>, <em>Anachronox</em>, <em>Arcanum</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>The Witcher</em>, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, my Dad saw me playing a role playing game (I don&rsquo;t really remember what it was, but needless to say it was some sort of open world). In the classic way that all fathers say things to their sons when their sons do something they don&rsquo;t understand, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get that game. Whenever I see you playing it you&rsquo;re just running somewhere.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was right. What&rsquo;s the main thing all the games I listed above have in common? The player spends at least 60% of the game running somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/running.jpg' height='703' width='800'><div class='caption'>Sure, you can sprint, but only for thirty seconds at a time for some reason.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Running is the essence of an open world game. You can sprinkle random encounters, crafting ingredients, beautiful vistas, or other marginal player rewards around your world, but in the end when I boot up <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>ArcaniA</em> (the awkwardly capitalized latest sequel to <em>Gothic</em>) I know that it&rsquo;s going to involve me sitting at my desk watching some dude in various levels of armor running for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately video games are a waste of time. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re designed to do. Still, there&rsquo;s wasted time, and there&rsquo;s <em>wasted</em> time. If I&rsquo;m going to watch a movie, I&rsquo;d rather cut straight to the part where the two fugitive cops bust in on the bad guys and have a big shoot fight, instead of watching their entire car trip from New York to Chicago. I&rsquo;d rather have delightfully interesting people to talk to all around me than ten miles between me and my next objective with nothing but some crafting ingredients and GODDAMN CLIFF RACERS.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/cliff_racer.jpg' height='604' width='700'><div class='caption'>The number one reason I&rsquo;m probably never playing <em>Morrowind</em> again.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, roleplaying games were very different. Computers couldn&rsquo;t render big city centers (they could hardly render anything), so games couldn&rsquo;t have sequences where you run around talking to people for hours. Look at the original <em>Mechwarrior</em> game (or at least what I remember it looking like):</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/mech_warrior.jpg' height='711' width='800'><div class='caption'>I tried playing <em>Mechwarrior</em> recently. It&rsquo;s pretty unplayable.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to go through the tedium of walking from your garage to the place where you get missions. You just clicked a button. For a while, during a time we can call the dark ages of wasting my time, games had no fast travel feature at all. In <em>Gothic</em> or <em>Morrowind</em>, we were supposed to be so enamored with the fact that the world is one big open place that we would put up with walking along the same stupid trail from one guy who tells us what to do to an area where monsters hang out so we can kill them. At that point, if anybody ever watched you play one of these games, all they would ever see you do is run somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we get to the modern age of open world games - the age of fast travel. In <em>Skyrim</em>, you can just click on any village or landmark that you&rsquo;ve already been to and you&rsquo;ll instantly be transported right there. I always start the game thinking, &ldquo;this game is so cool looking, and there&rsquo;s so much to explore that I&rsquo;m never going to use the fast travel.&rdquo; Then about five to ten hours into the game, I fast travel literally everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/map.jpg' height='458' width='800'><div class='caption'>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not walking all that way again.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with exploration in video games is that it&rsquo;s so artificial. Okay, so video games are all artificial - fair enough - but it really defeats the purpose. Exploration is about discovering neat little secrets, and the thrill you feel for uncovering them. You&rsquo;re in a world that was entirely put together by a bunch of people, though, so everything was placed there for you to find. You&rsquo;re meant to find it, and that makes it so much less exciting when you do. Skyrim is cram packed with hundreds of little stories and vignettes to find, but to me most of them had this sense that the designers were basically elbowing me in the side and winking the whole time. They just feel like I&rsquo;m being let in on an inside joke. They all end with me shrugging, saying &ldquo;well, there&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; looting all the crafting ingredients I could find, and then moving on to the next cave or hut in the woods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is that once you see that mountaintop, once you explore those ruins, you&rsquo;re done. Then all you want to do is get to those quest-delivering hotspots as quickly as possible and continue the story. Having to walk to your quest in a video game is just like having to walk to work every morning. Skyrim, then, is not a &ldquo;sticking swords in monsters&rdquo; simulator, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;commuting to work&rdquo; simulator. I hate commuting to work, and I would probably hate it a lot more if I had to keep killing feral wolves all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/lanoire.jpg' height='559' width='700'><div class='caption'>Or you could be like <em>LA Noire</em> and both make the world completely uninteresting <em>and</em> refuse to let me fast travel anywhere.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The game <em>Mount and Blade</em> is an interesting example. It&rsquo;s nothing but an open world; there&rsquo;s no story or objectives to complete. You&rsquo;re just a dude who can wander around this kingdom recruiting armies and fighting whomever you want. It&rsquo;s kind of neat how you can make your own substance and come up with a bit of a narrative anyway. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s some groundbreaking revolution in game design, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot that could be done with it. I&rsquo;ll have to save an analysis of it for a different posting, because that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. What <em>Mount and Blade</em> does that&rsquo;s relevant is that whenever you enter a town or village, you get a little screen that lets you go straight to the tavern or the shop or whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/mountnblade.jpg' height='563' width='800'><div class='caption'>Yes, &ldquo;steal cows&rdquo; is an option when you go to a village in <em>Mount and Blade</em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just like <em>Mechwarrior</em>. Thirty years later, we&rsquo;re back where we started. You don&rsquo;t get any ability to fast travel from city to city (because then there wouldn&rsquo;t be any game at all), but you don&rsquo;t have to wander around a poorly designed generic village map trying to find some fish to feed to your dudes. It cuts out a completely superfluous, time wasting section of unnecessary gameplay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s the point, isn&rsquo;t it? Good game design should cut out anything that&rsquo;s unnecessary. What is a game&rsquo;s point? What are players here to do? What is wasting their time and keeping them from doing that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose the argument is that we might as well just have a button that says &ldquo;play for me&rdquo; and leave it at that. Why not? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to skip boring, tedious parts? <strong>The game designer&rsquo;s job should be to give us that button but do everything he can to keep us from wanting to push it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/commuting_simulators/push_button.jpg' height='845' width='1244'><div class='caption'>You win!</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Make gameplay I want to play, not that I want to skip. If you&rsquo;re going to have an open world, it needs to be a place that I actually want to live in, where stuff happens that I want to experience. If you&rsquo;re going to have exploration, you have to make it feel natural. If you&rsquo;re going to make me walk around everywhere, give me a real companion, with personality and desires - another thing <em>Mount and Blade</em> does really well. Make your game fun all the time, or give me the ability to skip it when it isn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t waste my time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday I hope I can say to my son, in that way that all fathers say things to their sons when their sons do something they don&rsquo;t understand, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get this game. Why don&rsquo;t you ever have to run anywhere?&rdquo;</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>How &ldquo;crowdsourcing&rdquo; could save education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine that you are in your last semester of college. Yes, most of my readers were probably there not terribly long ago, but just bear with me. How do you feel? You probably feel excited or proud. You&rsquo;re ready to enter the world and make a place for yourself. You feel accomplished. You probably don&rsquo;t picture yourself trapped under an immovable weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To graduate from college today means entering a terrifying and seemingly endless world of debt. Tuition has skyrocketed over the years, and now it seems a student just can&rsquo;t make it through school without some form of student loan. We have as a society built a system that preys on the youth, telling them that the only way to succeed in life is to go to College. We then hand them a contract that commits them to pay for it for the rest of their lives. Perhaps the story we tell our kids is, indeed, true, but the result is a constant curse from which many graduates will never escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might see that nihilistic sentiment as an exaggeration. &ldquo;It surely isn&rsquo;t that bad,&rdquo; you might say. You obviously aren&rsquo;t one of my college graduate friends, because if you were you would know that it is. It really is that bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some quick Googling (are we supposed to capitalize that?) raises some startling statistics. College students who graduated in 2010 carried an average of <a href='http://projectonstudentdebt.org/state_by_state-data.php'>$25,250</a> in debt. We&rsquo;re not talking about doctors or lawyers, here. This is the average of all college graduates in the US. With unemployment rates among college graduates shooting up, too, many new grads have little hope of paying their debt off any time soon. <a href='http://www.mint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/StudentLoanRepayment.png'>Here</a>&rsquo;s an interesting infographic I stumbled upon about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now imagine that you&rsquo;re about to graduate, but you have this $25,000 cloud hanging over your head. If you pay $100 every single month, it will take you Twenty-one years to pay that off, and that&rsquo;s not even including interest. Now how do you feel? You&rsquo;re about to enter a world with the highest unemployment rate for college graduates ever, and you have to somehow pay every extra penny you make for the next two decades. What if you want to move somewhere? What if you want to start a family? Can you? What will you never accomplish because you can&rsquo;t afford to try?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ve scared you enough to stick with me here, because I have an idea that might just save future graduates from a similar fate. It might even save - dare I say it - the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real question that comes up here is not &ldquo;how could a system like this come about?&rdquo; The answer to that is obvious. As long as the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; economy rules our lives, this type of domination will always happen. I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s anything necessarily wrong with capitalism - that would have to be the subject of another post - I&rsquo;m just saying that this was inevitable. We built a world designed to target populations that are easily exploited financially, and then convince every single generation of children to get the best education they can, completely ignoring the cost. How is nobody outraged by this yet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real question that comes up here is &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t anyone done anything to stop this?&rdquo; Sure, we have websites with startling statistics, and we march around complaining about our debt and rising tuition, but awareness doesn&rsquo;t necessarily solve anything. We live in the future, where for the first time anybody with an Internet connection has as much theoretical power as anybody else. The time has come to come up with an Internet solution to this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we get to my idea. I propose a Crowdsourced Education Investment System. Students -  both past, present, and future - post their College fees on a secure and tightly regulated website (the tricky part will, of course, be to make sure posted needs are legitimate). This will work like Kickstarter or Ebay, except students are offering up their education expenses. Normal people who have some money they want to invest - people like you or me - can log on to this site and buy stakes in these students&rsquo; education. Eventually the students have to pay back these loans, but they go right back to their average Joe investors, not faceless greedy corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students, it will work just the same way as the system does now. You&rsquo;ll apply for loans based on your need, someone pays for you to go to school, and then you have to slowly pay it back after you graduate. The difference is that now the person giving you the money is a real human being, investing in your - and by extension their - future. When you do finally get out into the job market and that education pays off, it&rsquo;s not just paying off for some faceless investment firm like Sallie Mae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For investors, this system will have the same effect as putting money in a CD or another long-term investment, except that the potential interest rates could be substantially higher. Yes, it will be years before students pay the money back, but with interest rates of up to <a href='http://studentlendinganalytics.typepad.com/student_lending_analytics/2008/11/what-is-the-average-interest-rate-on-a-private-student-loan-today.html'>10%</a>, you&rsquo;ll make far more money than you would with your cash just sitting in a bank (earning less than one percent), with far less risk than investing in the Stock Market, and with infinitely more satisfaction than either. Personally, I would much rather invest a few grand in one of these Student Bonds than a complicated and volatile 401k or IRA plan. Let&rsquo;s face it, even in a worse-case scenario, wouldn&rsquo;t you rather lose money on a kid&rsquo;s education than on some stock in a company you hardly know anything about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So students get money (and an education), people have a tangible and trustworthy investment opportunity, and our society benefits from a new generation of educated, empowered young minds. Everybody wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effectively, it&rsquo;s a new investment firm, just like Citigroup or Sallie Mae, except that it&rsquo;s just a union of regular people. With outrage over the &ldquo;1%&rdquo; going through the roof (just like these student loans themselves), I&rsquo;m honestly surprised more people aren&rsquo;t clamoring to do things just like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real potential of this, though, is the long-term effects it could have on the world. If greedy fat cats aren&rsquo;t profiting anymore from taking advantage of this &ldquo;College or die&rdquo; mentality, we can finally stop hiking tuition and charging for every penny we can get. Maybe once we take the power away from the Few, College will actually be affordable again for the Many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so it&rsquo;s far-fetched and certainly optimistic. A product like this would be incredibly hard to get off the ground. How does it make money? How does it protect itself from inevitable liability issues? That&rsquo;s even before you consider what those big corporations will try to do if something like this actually gains traction. Still, what if? What if students could graduate from college without that crushing weight on their shoulders? What if we could come together as the community that we could so easily be and just support each other? What if it turned out that we didn&rsquo;t need &ldquo;investors&rdquo; at all?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kickstarter has proven that in this Internet-enabled world, we can do things on Our own. We can take care of Ourselves. We can and in fact have - dare I say it - changed the world! Imagine what today&rsquo;s students would be capable of if they could do anything but worry about their debt. Shouldn&rsquo;t we at least try?</p>\n\n",

      "title": "The Pentel Hybrid Technica",
      "text": "\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself, here, but I am really having a hard time being in favor of gel. Yes, technically gel is better than paste ink. It&rsquo;s darker, it&rsquo;s less vulnerable to fading or washing, it works on more mediums, and it&rsquo;s better on the environment. I just have a hard time getting behind it - especially for a general purpose pen. On paper it might be better, but on <em>paper</em>, it just doesn&rsquo;t do it for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel exactly the same way about the Hybrid Technica, a precision gel pen from Pentel. It&rsquo;s branded as a pen for artists, though it doesn&rsquo;t really look like one. It has a very fine point, a smooth line, and a little &ldquo;05&rdquo; on the cap. The problem is, though, I&rsquo;m really not sure what this pen is actually good for.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_2.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>The Technica comes in 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 millimeter sizes. Mine is the 0.5 mm.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>First, there&rsquo;s the name. I have absolutely no idea what makes this a hybrid. Perhaps they are emphasizing the use of gel in an art pen. My guess is that they&rsquo;re just trying to make it sound cool. Think about it. The biggest market for sleek looking capped Pentel pens is not artists - it&rsquo;s offices and students trying to look cool. If you name your pen that you&rsquo;re trying to brand as an artist&rsquo;s pen the &ldquo;Artistic Dingdong&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll scare away your only real customer base. &ldquo;Hybrid Technica&rdquo; belies the fact that this is not an artist&rsquo;s pen at heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the range of sizes. Certainly artists have plenty of reasons to use both a 0.3 and a 0.4 millimeter pen, but with a ballpoint tip and gel ink, I really can&rsquo;t believe these are precise enough to make that much of a difference. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have the other sizes to really see, so I&rsquo;ll just have to put that aside for now. The point (no pun intended) is that offices and students aren&rsquo;t going to care how many tenths of a millimeter their cool looking pens are. So Pentel makes these in a range of sizes for all of the ballpoint pen artists out there. Maybe the Technica really is an artist&rsquo;s pen, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, there&rsquo;s the ink. I won&rsquo;t go into tons of detail or comparisons. Needless to say, it compares pretty evenly with the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/391/A_Zebra_Three-Way'>Zebra</a> gel (though the Technica does, obviously, write a much finer line). Being gel, it&rsquo;s nice and dark, but it smears like crazy. Should an artist take the Technica over one of the other art focused gel pens out there? <em>What other art focused gel pens?</em> There&rsquo;s your problem. Other art pens have felt tips, because ballpoints just aren&rsquo;t good enough. So this isn&rsquo;t an artist&rsquo;s pen at heart, after all. This is an office pen trying to play in a field it isn&rsquo;t qualified for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the design. Other than the &ldquo;05&rdquo; on the cap, this thing is about as &ldquo;basic Pentel stick&rdquo; as you can get. Don&rsquo;t worry, the guys in the office won&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re trying to show off too much by taking this to the next staff meeting. It certainly isn&rsquo;t trying to be convenient, either. I tried carrying it as my standard pocket pen for a few days, which was not extremely enjoyable. It fell out of my pocket at one point and it actually cracked when it hit the floor. I almost lost the cap several times. Don&rsquo;t count on it being well built or convenient (it actually makes the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/391/A_Zebra_Three-Way'>Zebra F-301</a> feel sturdy). It&rsquo;s definitely meant to sit on a desk, then, but is it meant to sit on a desk in chemistry class, or sketching class?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wrote out a few pages of text with the Technica, just to see how it wrote. Aside from the blur issue, which is always present, I felt that it was just a bit too fine for my tastes. Some people might like the fine point for writing, but it was too harsh for me. I would take any of the pens in my last post over the Technica for writing, even the F-301.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s supposedly a pen for drawing, though, so I also wanted to see how it handled the sketch pad. You might have seen some of the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/395/Video_Games_Commuting_Simulators'>sketches</a> I made with it. It was nice and smooth. It mostly made a crisp line. It didn&rsquo;t feel like I was doing art, though. It just felt like I was doodling in the margins of my chemistry homework.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_sketch_3.jpg' height='235' width='300'><div class='caption'>It could have been what I was drawing, though.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It still has all of the failings of any other ballpoint. Sometimes it refused to draw solid, straight lines - or it refused to draw anything at all - which forced me to re-draw my lines, which quickly makes things look sloppy. It also still commits that most heinous of ballpoint sins - <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/391/A_Zebra_Three-Way'>Mosesing</a>. It may not be quite as pronounced - because of the much finer point - but it&rsquo;s still there, compromising any advantage gel is supposed to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_sketch_4.jpg' height='446' width='540'><div class='caption'>I&rsquo;m pretty much the best artist.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the hands of a real artist, though, it&rsquo;s a bit better. Alyson (somebody with a real art degree) took it for a spin, and in a few minutes came up with a sketch of me that I feel is actually pretty damn good.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_sketch_2.jpg' height='1212' width='800'><div class='caption'>She really captured my freckles - and steam breath.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This scribble-ey style is much more suited to the Technica, but you still can&rsquo;t erase its shortcomings. It isn&rsquo;t much of a problem anymore, but the Mosesing and broken lines are still there. The simple fact is that these problems just wouldn&rsquo;t be there if she was using a Micron.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_sketch_5.jpg' height='521' width='637'><div class='caption'>Imagine turning in your chemistry lab worksheet with this in the margins.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Alyson didn&rsquo;t hate the Technica. She liked the dark lines it put down, and liked its precision. However, she only used it in the first place because I asked her to, and as soon as I&rsquo;m done with this review (which is now), she&rsquo;ll probably go back to felt tips for her line work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the Hybrid Technica in a nutshell. It&rsquo;s trying to be an artist&rsquo;s pen, but it isn&rsquo;t as good as a felt tip. It&rsquo;s trying to keep to its taking-notes-in-chemistry-class roots, too, but it&rsquo;s straying just a bit too far. It isn&rsquo;t sturdy enough or convenient enough to carry in your pocket. It seems harder and harder to see the Technica filling any role, especially when you consider that it&rsquo;s <em>more</em> expensive than the same size Micron.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_3.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>Pentel says the Hybrid Technica has a fine point, I say it has no point at all.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This hybrid succeeds at bridging the gap between art and gel pens. Unfortunately, it only manages to keep all of the disadvantages of both. Artists should stick with felt, and leave gel where it belongs, writing checks and taking notes in chemistry class.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>And also . . .</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>As a side note - in case you need another reason not to use gel for anything but writing checks, I did another quick test of inks - the &ldquo;back of the hand&rdquo; test. I wrote a quick note on the back of my hand with the Parker Jotter, the F-402, the G-301, and the Hybrid Technica (in that order).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/hybrid_technica/hybrid_technica_1.jpg' height='533' width='800'><div class='caption'>I&rsquo;m just happy that a club finally accepted me as a member.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though it&rsquo;s supposed to be better on more surfaces, gel does not work well on skin, and the Technica&rsquo;s fine point made it almost useless. Both gels almost immediately washed away, too. At the end of the day, as I&rsquo;m typing this, only one of the inks has been able to outlast the others, and it probably isn&rsquo;t a huge surprise who it was. You guessed it - Parker (the ink). That&rsquo;s yet another reason to keep a Jotter handy, in case you&rsquo;re the sort that likes to - well - <em>jot</em> reminders or phone numbers down on the back of your hand, or if - like me - you&rsquo;re trying to recruit more members to your new favorite club.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n<p>Have you always wanted a super cool website? Do you want to enter the exciting and unfathomably vast and lonely sea of websites and mostly garbage that is the Internet? Do you look at Me with scornful envy in your eyes, cursing and damning and cursing again at my ability to website a whole bunch of times when you could never hope to website? Well, my friend, the time has come to learn that it isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t that hard to website - in fact, even you can do it! Over the next few posts, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll show you every step in the process of putting together and deploying a fully functional blog-based website! No longer will you be held back by your technical ignorance. In a few days, the only thing that will be able to stop you from having your own website is your inability to come up with interesting things to write about.\r\n\r\nI am a professional websiteman, by trade - that is, I specialize in doing websites. Aside from DenyConformity.com (pretty much the best website), I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve made quite a few others for friends, clients, companies, or myself. The hard part is designing and putting together a unique and interesting site layout, and for the most part that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s what I get paid a bunch of money for. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s actually really easy to website, though, if you don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t mind using pre-made components. Okay, so it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s still pretty complicated, but as long as you follow the proper procedure, for about $100 a year you can have your very own website on your own unique domain name. This is all assuming, of course, that you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve thought about what you actually want a website for, and have a clear goal in mind for what you want to do with it. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll show you the &acirc;&#128;&#156;how&acirc;&#128;&#157; but you have to bring the &acirc;&#128;&#156;why.&acirc;&#128;&#157;\r\n\r\nI should mention that this whole guide is about Windows 7. This is all equally easy in Mac OS or Windows Vista, but I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have those so I can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t really get screenshots of them.\r\n\r\nPart 1: Get Ready to Website\r\n\r\nYou could make things easier for yourself by just buying a hosting plan and doing everything there, but that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not the right way to do it. You could end up taking days or weeks (or years) setting up the site, and in the meantime your janky-assed &acirc;&#128;&#156;work in progress&acirc;&#128;&#157; is fully public for the world to see. Sure, you can set it up to show a &acirc;&#128;&#156;coming soon&acirc;&#128;&#157; page and block search engines until you get it finished, but it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s way easier to just set the site up on your computer and then deploy it to your web space.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/01.jpg]\r\nThat Bluehost.com lady is really ready to help you website.\r\n\r\nYou probably should go ahead and buy your hosting plan right away, though. The sooner you register your domain name, the better, so that nobody else steals it from you. Also, it can take up to a few days for your new domain name to start working, so you might as well do it now. I won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t get into explaining what a web host is, but basically you need a little hard drive to put your website on which is visible to the Internet. There are many companies you can use, and most of them are very similar - just make sure your plan includes a MySQL database (you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll be hard pressed to find one that doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t) and email addresses if you want your own email addresses. DenyConformity.com is hosted on Bluehost, and I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m very pleased with them. Whatever you do, avoid GoDaddy or Startlogic.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/0-1.jpg]\r\nDamn, pin15.com is not available.\r\n\r\nThe process is different based on who you use, but it should be pretty simple. Just find the &acirc;&#128;&#156;sign up now&acirc;&#128;&#157; button and fill in the blanks. Most hosting companies will give you a domain name with your plan, and they will help you register it (and make sure it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s available). There is really a whole industry around picking a domain name, but don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t overthink it. If you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re setting up a personal website, just use your name (dot com). If you have a small business, use the company name - or some variation of it (dot com). You can use a .org or .net address if you absolutely have to, but you should stick with a .com. Also try to avoid dashes, underscores, or other awkward characters; it can be harder to tell people &acirc;&#128;&#156;something dash something dot com&acirc;&#128;&#157; than just &acirc;&#128;&#156;something something dot com.&acirc;&#128;&#157; \r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/0-2.jpg]\r\nWhat a waste of a perfectly good domain name!\r\n\r\nIf your preferred domain isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t available, but it obviously isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t a real site (like the picture above), it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s probably held by a cybersquatter. These ne&#039;erdowells are the scum of the Internet, but there isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t much you can do about them. Sometimes GoDaddy can help you buy these domains, usually because they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re the ones illegally holding them. If all else fails, you can do a WHOIS lookup on the domain to get the contact info for the people who registered the domain. Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t expect much luck, because usually these are very undesirable types, but you never know.\r\n\r\nAnyway, once you get the hosting all squared away, they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll send you an email with a bunch of technical gobbledygook in it about your new website. Make sure you archive, print out, or otherwise save that info in a place. Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t worry about it for now, but know that it is important. Now you just have to wait patiently for Magic to Happen so that your new website becomes an Internet (it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s all very technical).\r\n\r\nDon&acirc;&#128;&#153;t just sit back, though, because you still have a lot of work to do! We&acirc;&#128;&#153;re going to create your website right there on your computer, which means we have to turn your computer into a sort of makeshift Internet. Unfurrow that brow; it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s actually pretty easy. \r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/1.jpg]\r\nOpen up the Start Menu, and hit the &acirc;&#128;&#156;Control Panel&acirc;&#128;&#157; button. If you don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have a &acirc;&#128;&#156;Control Panel&acirc;&#128;&#157; button, then you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll have to get to the control panel a different way. Try just typing &acirc;&#128;&#156;Control Panel&acirc;&#128;&#157; in the search box. Just get to the Control Panel, and then meet me at the next step.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/2.jpg]\r\nHere&acirc;&#128;&#153;s the default Control Panel view. Click on &acirc;&#128;&#156;Uninstall a program&acirc;&#128;&#157; under &acirc;&#128;&#156;Programs&acirc;&#128;&#157; Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t worry about your computer being powerful enough to Internet. If it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s running Windows 7 okay, it will be able to Internet okay, at least as much as we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re going to ask it to, which won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t be much. It won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have to Internet terribly hard.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/3.jpg]\r\nLook, stop worrying about how many C++ Redistributables I have, and just click &acirc;&#128;&#156;Turn Windows features on or off.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Click &acirc;&#128;&#156;allow&acirc;&#128;&#157; or whatever if Windows gives you guff about wanting to use your computer.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/4.jpg]\r\nBack in the day you would disable some of these things to save precious Megabytes on your hard drive for sweet games, but with today&acirc;&#128;&#153;s multifoliate Jiggabytes, you can use your computer for years without ever needing to remove Solitaire. Anyway, we want to click the little box next to &acirc;&#128;&#156;Internet Information Services.&acirc;&#128;&#157; That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s what turns your computer into an Internet! Note: I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll be referring to Internet Information Services as IIS from now on.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/5.jpg]\r\nThis is what should happen when you click the box. It automatically selects the most common options, which includes &acirc;&#128;&#156;Web Management Tools&acirc;&#128;&#157; and &acirc;&#128;&#156;World Wide Web Services.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Also, under &acirc;&#128;&#156;World Wide Web Services&acirc;&#128;&#157; open &acirc;&#128;&#156;Application Development Features&acirc;&#128;&#157; and make sure &acirc;&#128;&#156;CGI&acirc;&#128;&#157; is selected.  If for some reason you already have IIS installed, make sure you have subitems installed like you see in the picture above so you can properly website when we get to steps down the road.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/6.jpg]\r\nAfter a bit of a wait (but not long enough for me to get a screenshot, apparently), you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll have to restart your computer. Make sure you save anything you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re working on, like for example a post on your blog that you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been working on for like an hour but forgot to save. You don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want to have to start from the freaking beginning again even though the second time you write it you aren&acirc;&#128;&#153;t anywhere near as funny as the first time.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/7.jpg]\r\nWhen your computer comes back up, it won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t look any different - and it won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t behave any differently either (it shouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t, at least). However, your computer is now basically an Internet. Now you have to do some configuration to get a website set up.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/8.jpg]\r\nType &acirc;&#128;&#156;Administrative Tools&acirc;&#128;&#157; into your Start Menu, and find the Administrative Tools. It might show up before you finish typing the whole thing, so it will save you some precious finger movements.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/9.jpg]\r\nThis is where you can do some serious Administration on your computer. For now, you want &acirc;&#128;&#156;Computer Management&acirc;&#128;&#157;\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/10.jpg]\r\nExpand &acirc;&#128;&#156;Services and Applications&acirc;&#128;&#157; and pick &acirc;&#128;&#156;Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager&acirc;&#128;&#157; from the list on the left. This is where you tell your computer how to deal with being an Internet. There&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a ton to the IIS manager, but we won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t need to mess with most of it.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/11.jpg]\r\nYou should see this &acirc;&#128;&#156;Connections&acirc;&#128;&#157; section, on the left side of the Management Console. You&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll see your computer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s name (that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s your computer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s name, FYI - mine is called SEPTEM for some reason). Expand that and also expand &acirc;&#128;&#156;Sites&acirc;&#128;&#157; and you should see &acirc;&#128;&#156;Default Web Site.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Click on it. If you don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have a &acirc;&#128;&#156;Default Web Site,&acirc;&#128;&#157; something has gone wrong. Try removing and reinstalling IIS. I brought you here to show you that your computer is running a tiny little Internet. You&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll need to get back here a few times over the rest of the process, so it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s good to know how to get to the IIS console and your Default Site.\r\n\r\n[/assets/images/how_to_website/12.jpg]\r\nOpen a web browser (any will do), and type &acirc;&#128;&#156;localhost&acirc;&#128;&#157; into the address bar. If you see the IIS7 logo, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re in business! You&acirc;&#128;&#153;re looking at your very own website running right there on your computer. Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t worry, it only exists on your computer, and only you can get there. When you go to &acirc;&#128;&#156;localhost&acirc;&#128;&#157; you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re telling the browser to look for a web server on the local computer. You could also go to http://127.0.0.1, since that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a computer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s internal IP address (by default, anyway). Anyway, if you got that lovely IIS welcome screen, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve successfully completed the first part of the process.\r\n\r\nSo today we (maybe) bought a new hosting plan somewhere and got the ball rolling on getting some real webspace, then we set up IIS and took a look at a tiny little Internet running right there inside your computer. Next time we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll look at setting up and configuring a new local Web Site, and we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll install and configure a MySQL database.</p>\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>So you&rsquo;ve enabled your computer&rsquo;s secret ability to be an Internet. Big deal! What do you do with that puny little Internet of yours? You make a website, of course! Ok, then, off you go; go have some website. What, you still don&rsquo;t know how to website?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, right, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to teach you. Well, we had better get started, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 2: PHP Doesn&rsquo;t Stand For Anything</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to start with a bit of a lecture, I&rsquo;m afraid. Essentially, the Internet is made up of two types of computers - servers and clients. Your computer&rsquo;s browser is a client. It connects to websites and downloads HyperText Markup Language (that&rsquo;s what HTML stands for) so you can read about celebrities and check Facebook statuses. A server compiles lots of code and does all sorts of magic on it before sending it out to the client as HTML. As you might imagine, there are therefore two basic types of programming for the Internet - server-side and client-side. The end goal of all web programming, whether on the client or the server, is to generate certain HTML markup for the browser to display. For the most part, then, all languages for making websites are designed to wrangle data somehow, turn it into HTML somehow, and send it to the browser somehow. This is about as basic as I can be without just saying &ldquo;ELECTROBOX DO MAGIC.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One popular client-side programming language is called Javascript (it&rsquo;s actually a scripting language, but we don&rsquo;t need to get that specific). A popular server-side programming language is called PHP (again, it&rsquo;s a scripting language, but whatever). Neither is better or worse, they have very important strengths and weaknesses and are used for very specific and different things. How this matters to you is that you need to configure your new web server to handle the server-side technologies that you&rsquo;re going to throw at it. Since client-side stuff doesn&rsquo;t happen on the server, your server could not possibly care less about it. By default, Microsoft&rsquo;s web server technology (IIS) doesn&rsquo;t know how to deal with PHP, so we need to tell it what&rsquo;s up.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/16.jpg' height='263' width='393'><div class='caption'>There is some contention over what PHP actually stands for. Originally it meant &ldquo;Personal Home Page&rdquo; but now it stands for &ldquo;PHP: Hypertext PreProcessor&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t really make any sense. Anyway, just head over to <a href='windows.php.net/download/' target='_blank'>windows.php.net/download/</a> and download the latest Non Thread Safe version of PHP (get the first &ldquo;Zip&rdquo; on the page). Don&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;Non Thread Safe.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s just technical mumbo-jumbo that means nothing to you.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/17.jpg' height='401' width='549'><div class='caption'>Open up a Windows Explorer window (do this quickly by holding the Windows Key - the little flag button between the left control and alt keys - and pressing &ldquo;E&rdquo;).

You should find two versions in your php folder, php.ini-development and php.ini-production. These are sample files that have most of the usual configuration settings for those environments.

Just rename that file &ldquo;php.ini&rdquo; You should probably <a href='http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/show-or-hide-file-name-extensions' target='_blank'>disable</a> the &ldquo;hide file extensions for known filetypes&rdquo; setting in your folder options if you haven&rsquo;t already.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/20.jpg' height='471' width='615'><div class='caption'>You can just open php.ini in Notepad, now (right click it and go to &ldquo;open with&rdquo;). This can be a really intimidating file, so try not to get lost in all that crazy stuff. Also, don&rsquo;t touch anything, because you can cause lots of problems if you mess something up here. Just find the following settings and make sure they&rsquo;re set as such (you can hit Ctrl + F to search for each setting). Each setting should be on its own line, and will probably have a semi-colon before it. Make sure you remove that semi-colon, as it tells PHP to ignore the line. To be clear, make sure your php.ini file has the following things all on their own lines exactly as they are here:</div>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>fastcgi.inpersonate = 1</p>\r\n<p>fastcgi.logging = 0</p>\r\n<p>cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1</p>\r\n<p>cgi.force_redirect = 0</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a wimp or something, you can just download the <a href='/assets/images/how_to_website/php.ini-denyconformity'>php.ini</a> file I prepared for this tutorial and put it in your C:/php folder (make sure to rename it &ldquo;php.ini&rdquo; too).

If you see a bunch of stuff about PHP, you have successfully completed this part of the tutorial. If not, you&rsquo;ll have to go back and see what you missed. I&rsquo;ll just continue this thing as if it all worked, though.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve actually done quite a bit just now.  First, you installed PHP on your computer, and then you set up your computer&rsquo;s web server to properly use it when somebody accesses a PHP file. You then created a new file that calls a special function in PHP which poops out a bunch of info about your computer&rsquo;s version of PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website is just a directory on a computer somewhere. Your new &ldquo;Default Web Site&rdquo; is just a folder on your computer (&ldquo;C:inetpubwwwroot&rdquo; by default). Any files inside that folder will be accessible when you go to &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; in a browser, and the server will handle it a different way depending on what kind of file it is. When you tell the browser to open &ldquo;index.php&rdquo; (which it does by default when you don&rsquo;t give it a specific file to open - remember when you told it to do that?), it sends a request to the server for that file. The server is all, &ldquo;woah, that&rsquo;s a PHP file, brah&rdquo; (because you told it that all files with a .php extension are special files in the Handler Mapping, and your computer is apparently kind of a d-bag) and it opens the file with &ldquo;php-cgi.exe&rdquo; just like you told it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PHP and your computer compile the code in the file into delicious beeps and boops, and then process those beeps and boops however they&rsquo;re designed to be processed. In this case, you&rsquo;ve used the function &ldquo;phpinfo()&rdquo; which simply creates this cool little list of all the stuff that&rsquo;s going on in your server, PHP-wise. You computer compiled your script, and the PHP files you installed processed that function into a bunch of Hypertext which get sent along to your browser. All that stuff happened the instant you hit &ldquo;enter&rdquo; in your browser&rsquo;s address bar! Neat!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/30.jpg' height='585' width='840'><div class='caption'>This is the actual Hypertext that your browser is showing.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Try right clicking on the page and select &ldquo;View Source.&rdquo; Look at all that code that your little web server sent to your browser! That shows the power of server-side technology like PHP. The actual code for the page is only one function - &ldquo;phpinfo()&rdquo; - but the code sent to the browser is vastly different. This is only scratching the surface of what you can do with server-side scripting in PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we&rsquo;re one step closer to a super cool website, and now you have a really great development platform for playing around with PHP (among other things). Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be back here with another important step in getting your computer ready to be a super cool Internet, and then we&rsquo;ll get on with doing a website - I promise. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be able to website like a champ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Related Reading</h5>\r\n<p>In the meanwhile, if you&rsquo;re interested in learning a bit more about client- and server-side languages, there are some great resources online for you to check out.

Enough jibber-jabber; let&rsquo;s get on with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 3: The SQL Sequel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to have a really cool website place, you&rsquo;ll need something to store lots of data in. That&rsquo;s what a database is for, believe it or not. Almost every website on the Internet uses some sort of database, and almost all of those use some form of Structured Query Language, or SQL (pronounced &ldquo;sequel&rdquo;). Modern smartphones all have a SQL database on them, too (iPhones and Android phones really aren&rsquo;t that different). The most popular SQL database for websites is called MySQL, and the best thing about it is that it&rsquo;s free! Almost definitely the webspace you bought as part of the first section of this tutorial includes a MySQL database with it, but you need one on your development environment so you can get a cool website set up.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/14.jpg' height='382' width='730'><div class='caption'>Head over to <a href='http://www.mysql.com/downloads/installer' target='_blank'>http://www.mysql.com/downloads/installer</a> and download the latest version of the MySQL installer package. When it asks you to log in you can just say &ldquo;No thanks, just take me to the downloads.&rdquo; You should then see a list of US mirrors. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter which mirror you pick (they&rsquo;re just different places you can download the file from). Click the little &ldquo;http&rdquo; next to the closest one to wherever you are. It&rsquo;s a couple hundred megabytes, so it might take a while to download.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While you&rsquo;re waiting for it to download, why not read some funny stuff on the Internet? You can pick up the rest of this tutorial when it&rsquo;s done downloading. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s done? You&rsquo;re back? Cool.

The default Installation and Data paths should be perfectly fine.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/34.jpg' height='615' width='818'><div class='caption'>My computer didn&rsquo;t need any additional requirements, but yours might - it depends on how many C++ redistributables you have installed (among other things).

Hit next a couple times until you can hit finish, and then hit that.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So now you have a database running on your computer. You&rsquo;ll hardly be able to find proof of this, but just trust me. Before we can really do anything with it, we&rsquo;ll need to download a really great tool called PHPMyAdmin. It&rsquo;s a whole website that you&rsquo;re going to run on your computer that connects to your MySQL database using PHP so you can create databases, manipulate tables, or do whatever you might want to do.

      "text": "\n\n<p>Are you ready to put a website together, now? I bet you&rsquo;re thinking, <em>&ldquo;hey, this hasn&rsquo;t been terribly easy and all we&rsquo;ve done is set up some useless web server that we can&rsquo;t even really use. I don&rsquo;t really know how to PHP or anything. How do you expect me to make a whole website?&rdquo;</em> The fact is, I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s time to come clean. We&rsquo;re going to cheat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 4: Stop the Wordpresses</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of wordpress. It&rsquo;s a pretty big thing on the Internet, and there&rsquo;s a pretty simple reason why. It&rsquo;s powerful, it&rsquo;s easy to customize, it&rsquo;s vastly extendable, and it&rsquo;s free. Unless you have some pretty specific requirements, you have a budget in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, or you&rsquo;re an obsessive idiot like me, there really isn&rsquo;t much reason to make a website without just using Wordpress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wordpress isn&rsquo;t just for blogs, either. By building plugins and other modifications you could get it to do absolutely anything you can think of. Well, maybe <em>you</em> can&rsquo;t (no offense), but you can probably find some plugins and things that other people have made that will do whatever you want. That&rsquo;s Wordpress&rsquo;s true power: it has an incredibly active development community. Also, if you use Wordpress you&rsquo;ll be able to use Google Adsense ads and potentially make money from it, which is more than I can say <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/376/Ads_on_DenyConformitycom'>about</a> DenyConformity.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ll get to the plugins and things down the road. For now, we have to get your itsy-bitsy web server set up to host a Wordpress site. Okay, so you can just go to wordpress.com and set up your own blog there, where you can do plenty of stuff for absolutely free. You can even point a domain name to it and save yourself a lot of money and effort by not dealing with a web host. However, hosting a Wordpress site on your own web space puts all of the power in your hands, and you&rsquo;ll be able to do quite a bit more stuff with your site than if you just went with Wordpress hosting. Also, you&rsquo;ll feel much cooler because you have your own website, which is actually pretty cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/55.jpg' height='705' width='1013'><div class='caption'>First off, you&rsquo;ll need to head to <a href='http://wordpress.org/download/' target='_blank'>wordpress.org/download/</a> and click on the &ldquo;Download WordPress&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s not huge, so it won&rsquo;t take very long, but it&rsquo;s good to get it downloading so it will be ready for us.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/58.jpg' height='429' width='589'><div class='caption'>Now first you have to create a new folder somewhere. This will be the folder in which your website will live. Put it somewhere easy to get to, because you&rsquo;ll be hanging out there a lot. I created my own Windows Library for web stuff, because I do a lot of it, but you don&rsquo;t have to go that far. Look, I&rsquo;m not going to pry into your personal organization of your folders, so just make a folder somewhere. Also, remember where you put it.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/59.jpg' height='526' width='586'><div class='caption'>Right click your new folder and select &ldquo;Properties.&rdquo; Now find the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab. You have to give IIS access to read your folder so that you can open it as a website. By default IIS has access to nothing (except the default Web Site folder) on your computer - it&rsquo;s more secure this way.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/60.jpg' height='530' width='597'><div class='caption'>Click &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Add...&rdquo; and then type &ldquo;IIS_IUSRS&rdquo; into the box. Hit &ldquo;Check Names&rdquo; and it should turn into what you see above (it&rsquo;s your computer name slash IIS_IUSRS). Hit &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and then do the same thing for &ldquo;Users.&rdquo; Now the folder should have the following under &ldquo;Group or user names&rdquo; (there could be more, but it needs at least these): &ldquo;SYSTEM,&rdquo; &ldquo;*Your Username*,&rdquo; &ldquo;Administrators,&rdquo; &ldquo;Users,&rdquo; and &ldquo;IIS_IUSRS.&rdquo; Your folder is set up!</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/56.jpg' height='622' width='991'><div class='caption'>Now we&rsquo;ll head back to our old friend, the IIS Manager (remember: &ldquo;inetmgr&rdquo;). We could install Wordpress into our &ldquo;Default Web Site&rdquo; and leave it at that, but it&rsquo;s usually best to just create a new website and work with a clean slate. Don&rsquo;t worry about all that work you did to set up PHP. We did that at the server level, so those are all master settings that will be in effect on every website you create.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/57.jpg' height='628' width='991'><div class='caption'>Open your server, and then select &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; in the Connections area. Here you should see the only website you have running, the Default Web Site. Click &ldquo;Add Web Site...&rdquo; to add a new website, believe it or not.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be wondering how you can have two websites running on one computer. That&rsquo;s pretty astute of you, sport. You only have one address to go to, &ldquo;localhost,&rdquo; so how can we get two websites at once? The answer is by using different ports. Use a port, sport! An Internet is like a bit loading dock, like they have on the big, fat butt of a Wal-Mart (not the big, fat butts of the people shopping at Walmart - those only have one port). You have to back your Internet-truck full of beeps and boops up to a specific door on your computer&rsquo;s loading dock for it to accept you. There are thousands of possible ports, and different programs use different ones. Most beeps and boops for the Wild World of Web - including websites and stuff like that - travel through port 80. Just like how browsers access &ldquo;index.php&rdquo; by default when you don&rsquo;t specify a file, they will access port 80 by default if you don&rsquo;t specify otherwise (specify a specific port with a colon. No, we aren&#039;t talking about fat butts again - I mean &ldquo;localhost:80&rdquo;). All we have to do is set up a new website on port 81, and then we&rsquo;ll be able to call it up by opening port 81 on localhost (which is done by going to &ldquo;localhost:81&rdquo;). Let&rsquo;s do that, shall we?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/61.jpg' height='535' width='550'><div class='caption'>So &ldquo;Add Web Site...&rdquo; and then fill out the form. For the name, just put whatever. Hit the &ldquo;Select...&rdquo; button and pick &ldquo;DefaultAppPool&rdquo; from the list (then hit OK). The Physical path needs to be that folder you just created. I told you to remember where you put it. Now, under &ldquo;Port&rdquo; change it to 81. Now this new site will only be accessible from port 81, because the Default Web Site is using port 80. Make sure &ldquo;Start Web site immediately&rdquo; is checked, and hit &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; </div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/62.jpg' height='528' width='813'><div class='caption'>If you try to access the site now (by going to &ldquo;localhost:81&rdquo;), you&rsquo;ll see something like this. This is because there&rsquo;s nothing in that folder you created. When there is no default file (no index.php or index.html), the server tries to just send a list of what is in the directory. However, by default it&rsquo;s forbidden from doing that for security reasons, so it has a bit of a crisis. This particular crisis is called an Error 403.14.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/63.jpg' height='508' width='507'><div class='caption'>There&rsquo;s still more to do before you can put some files there, though, so your new web site will just have to keep having a crisis. You&rsquo;ll have to start up your MySQL server, if it isn&rsquo;t running. Check your Task Manager for &ldquo;mysqld.exe&rdquo; and if it isn&rsquo;t there, go to C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.X/bin and run &ldquo;mysqld.exe.&rdquo; You could have your MySQL server run every time Windows starts up by placing a shortcut to mysqld.exe in your Startup folder (which is in &ldquo;All Programs&rdquo; in the Start Menu), but unless you plan on playing around with your MySQL server a lot, you don&rsquo;t need to tie up your memories all the time.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/64.jpg' height='572' width='859'><div class='caption'>Log into phpMyAdmin again (<a href='http://localhost/phpMyAdmin' target='_blank'>localhost/phpMyAdmin</a>).

Hit the &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; button to get a really strong password, but for Pete&rsquo;s sake write it down so you don&rsquo;t lose it. Next, and this is important, select the option &ldquo;Create database with same name and grant all privileges&rdquo; before you hit &ldquo;Add user.&rdquo; Now you should have a new database on the left, called whatever you called your new user.

      "text": "\n\n<p>This is where things get a bit tricky - for me, not you. Now that you have a fully functional website running on your computer, how you set it up is entirely up to you. What kind of website do you want? Basically there are two types of websites that we&rsquo;re dealing with here. You could be making a blog, where you&rsquo;ll post some sort of regular content, or you could be making an info-site, where you&rsquo;ll simply describe a product, company, or yourself. Sure there are plenty of other websites, like e-commerce, social networking, content sharing, or web apps. However, those are all way more complicated affairs that you can&rsquo;t really accomplish with a simple Wordpress site, so we&rsquo;ll stick with what is ultimately 75% of websites out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See my ongoing <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/389/DenyConformitycom_Redesign_Journal_part_4'>design journals</a> for more of my thoughts about what a website is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that I can&rsquo;t just tell you to &ldquo;go here&rdquo; and &ldquo;do this&rdquo; this time around because it might not apply to everybody out there. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, though. I&rsquo;m going to build out a complete website, using the Wordpress platform we set up in the last few tutorials. You can follow along with me if you want, just to get a feel for how everything works, or you can pick and choose what you want to use for your site. I&rsquo;ll try to cover as many Wordpress things as I can get to, so we can really get our hands dirty and built exactly the website Gotham needs, as well as the one Gotham wants! First, though, it&rsquo;s best to get a game plan together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5: Get a Game Plan Together</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Just for the sake of this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll come up with a random website idea and go through the process of getting it set up. Let&rsquo;s make a website for . . . let&rsquo;s see . . . oh, how about my girlfriend Alyson? Let&rsquo;s pretend that she&rsquo;s been asking me to make her a website for like a year and I&rsquo;m just getting around to it. I mean, that&rsquo;s just a bit of background to give the site I&rsquo;m making some purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, before we get started, we need to come up with a list of requirements for the new site. Technically we should have done this before we set up IIS or Wordpress, but whatever. The point is just to have a clear idea of what we need Wordpress to do for us. Sit down with your client (in this case it&rsquo;s probably you) and get a list of what they want. Let&rsquo;s just say that Alyson told me what she wanted in a website like a year ago and I made a mental note of it to make it happen some day. It&rsquo;s good to have a sort of mission statement kind of thing so your website has a real purpose. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working with:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Alyson Thiel is an independent artist who wants to promote her work and have a platform for sharing ideas and pieces with other artists.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s that easy. It&rsquo;s not a thesis or anything. Just be clear about generally what kind of content you&rsquo;re making, and whether it&rsquo;s a more static info-site or a regular blog type affair. Technically Alyson just wants an info-site and a portfolio for posting all of her arts, but I&rsquo;ll throw a blog in there too for the sake of tutorialization. Next you should get a list of a few things the site needs to get done. This includes any pages you want to have and any specific functions or visual things you want to see. As far as I&rsquo;ve been able to remember after like a year of putting off thinking about it - er, <em>for the sake of this tutorial, I mean</em> - this is what I know:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>She wants it to look pretty. This is actually pretty average for what you&rsquo;ll hear from a client as far as art direction goes.</li>\r\n<li>She wants a home page with a fancy cycling banner that shows off her work.</li>\r\n<li>She wants a biography page with a - well - <em>biography</em> on it, I guess.</li>\r\n<li>She wants a CV page to post her CV on</li>\r\n<li>She wants a &ldquo;work&rdquo; page which has image galleries for her art, split into different categories or whatever</li>\r\n<li>I&rsquo;ll include a &ldquo;blog&rdquo; page which will be basically a blog, including comments and all that.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>Another step you want to take is to get the actual content you want to show on each page. I&rsquo;ll let Alyson write her own biography and CV, and we&rsquo;re working on getting digital versions of her arts, but I can just use placeholder stuff for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so you have all that stuff together? You have a clear concept and you&rsquo;re ready to put it together? Then let&rsquo;s start tackling these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 A: Set that Thang Up</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I said you can just follow along if you want to and whatever, but you should stick with me through this part, because this is universally important stuff. Actually, the next part is pretty important, too. On second thought, forget I ever said you could go on your own. What was I thinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/75.jpg' height='810' width='1017'><div class='caption'>When you loginto your dashboard, you probably see this &ldquo;Welcome to your blah whatever&rdquo; message. You can ignore that, really. I&rsquo;ll take you through each page in the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section, and explain what they do.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/77.jpg' height='991' width='920'><div class='caption'>There are a lot of options in the General Settings section. If you don&rsquo;t need a tagline (like me), you can make it blank. Leave the URLs as they are for now, but know that you&rsquo;ll have to change these when you deploy the site. Changing the &ldquo;New User Default Role&rdquo; will change what non-you people will be able to do when they register with your site, so it should probably be left as &ldquo;Subscriber&rdquo; unless you want people to be able to contribute stuff (note that is for posts, not comments - people will still be able to post comments). Pick your timezone carefully, and then set the Date and Time formatting as you like.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/103.jpg' height='617' width='957'><div class='caption'>In Writing, you can change some settings for your posts. You can also add a bookmarklet and set up &ldquo;Post via e-mail.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t worry about the bookmarklet or the email thing for now, because those aren&rsquo;t really usable until you deploy the site to a real web space.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/104.jpg' height='607' width='951'><div class='caption'>The Reading page lets you control some settings for your blog and whatnot. You can also tell Wordpress to have a static front page instead of a blog. We&rsquo;ll return here when we&rsquo;re messing with pages, in the next part of this tutorial.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/78.jpg' height='750' width='918'><div class='caption'>The Discussion Settings can get pretty complicated. For the most part the default settings are fine, but if you want any specific options for comments on your posts, you can probably find those options here. By default any commenters have to submit their name and email address, and their comments have to be approved by an admin (you) before they can be seen. This will help stop idiots and spam, but it can be kind of hassle for both you and your commenters. I&rsquo;ll show you how to install a CAPTCHA plugin later (it&rsquo;s pretty simple), so you might be able to turn all that off. One setting I&rsquo;m changing is that I&rsquo;m turning off &ldquo;Avatar Display&rdquo; down at the bottom of this page. I don&rsquo;t see any need to show little icons (which are usually just blank) for every comment.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/105.jpg' height='601' width='946'><div class='caption'>In Media you can control settings for images in posts. These defaults are all perfectly fine, and you should only mess with this if you have specific problems with images at some point.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/76.jpg' height='595' width='925'><div class='caption'>The privacy setting should still be set to &ldquo;Ask search engines not to index this site&rdquo; which is how you want it while it&rsquo;s still in the development environment. Still, it&rsquo;s good to know where this setting lives, so you can turn it on when you&rsquo;ve deployed the site.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/101.jpg' height='688' width='904'><div class='caption'>In the Permalinks section, you can control how the URLs for your pages and posts will look. It&rsquo;s a good idea to switch to something besides the default, because if you include the date and post name in the URL it will be much better for search engines and whatnot. I like using &ldquo;Day and name.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/79.jpg' height='751' width='920'><div class='caption'>You should also take a look at the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; section of the Dashboard. In &ldquo;Your Profile&rdquo; you can fill out your personal information, which will be attached to each post you make on the site. Personally I don&rsquo;t care about this for the admin account. I will create a separate account for Alyson so she can post things to the site, and she can adjust the personal info for herself. You can go ahead and make the admin you and then you can just make posts right from the admin account, or you can create a new account (&ldquo;Users&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Add New&rdquo;) for yourself and make posts with that. It&rsquo;s up to you. Just know that any posts you make are tied to the account you were logged in with when you made the post.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/80.jpg' height='596' width='924'><div class='caption'>Another thing I like to do is just get rid of all the &ldquo;Sample&rdquo; garbage that Wordpress has when you first set it up. Go to the &ldquo;Pages&rdquo; section (click &ldquo;Pages&rdquo; in the dashboard menu), mouse over the &ldquo;Sample Page&rdquo; page and select &ldquo;Trash.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll show you how to make a new page later, so don&rsquo;t worry about losing anything.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/81.jpg' height='587' width='917'><div class='caption'>Do the same thing with the &ldquo;Posts&rdquo; section, removing the &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; post from the list. This will also remove any comments that are on the post. One thing about Wordpress is that these Sample items aren&rsquo;t actually gone, they&rsquo;re just in the trash, so you could get them back if you wanted. It&rsquo;s good to know in the future if you ever accidentally delete something you need.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/96.jpg' height='561' width='922'><div class='caption'>We also need to set up a couple more folders so we&rsquo;ll be able to upload images to our Wordpress blog. <strong>This is a really important step that I totally meant to wait until now to tell you.</strong> First go to the directory where you installed Wordpress and find the folder called &ldquo;wp-content.&rdquo; Then go to the root of your hard drive (C:) and create a folder called &ldquo;tmp.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/97.jpg' height='552' width='435'><div class='caption'>Now do this for each of those folders: right click the folder, select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; and go to the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab. Press &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Users.&rdquo; Check the box under &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; for &ldquo;Full Control.&rdquo; All the checkboxes should be checked now for &ldquo;Users&rdquo; on both the &ldquo;wp-content&rdquo; and the &ldquo;tmp&rdquo; folders. This will ensure that Wordpress can write files to those locations.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we have a clean slate that we can move forward with. Let&rsquo;s make it look nice, though, shall we? Now we&#039;ll take a trip through the &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; section of the Dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 5 B: Theme Heat</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/82.jpg' height='588' width='918'><div class='caption'>The first page of the Appearance section will show you what themes you have available. The default Wordpress theme is called Twenty Eleven, and it&rsquo;s okay, but we want something a little less default. You might notice you have another theme installed, called Twenty Ten (this is true as I write this, but in the future they&rsquo;ll probably change the default themes at some point). Twenty ten is just like Twenty Eleven, but it&rsquo;s one less.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/83.jpg' height='589' width='918'><div class='caption'>Wordpress has a built-in system for installing new themes, which is in the &ldquo;Install Themes&rdquo; tab of the Themes page of the Appearance section of the Dashboard. It&rsquo;s a pain to install themes that way, actually, so you should go to <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/' target='_blank'>wordpress.org/extend/themes/</a> to browse them there. As I write this, there are 1,516 different free themes for Wordpress. That&rsquo;s cool because there are plenty of options, but it&rsquo;s difficult because that can be intimidating (plus let&#039;s be honest, a lot of them are garbage). Luckily, they have a handy Tag Filter you can use to bring the results down to a more manageable size. You can also just browse the latest submitted themes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/84.jpg' height='796' width='1009'><div class='caption'>I want something that&rsquo;s mainly white, so I searched for &ldquo;white&rdquo; and &ldquo;light.&rdquo; I also added &ldquo;Flexible Width&rdquo; (which I recommend that you do, too) and &ldquo;Custom Background&rdquo; to the options. That narrowed the selection down to 20 options. If you know you want a two- or three-column layout, or you know you want a specific feature, you can limit it further. I want to find something that&rsquo;s pretty open so I can still use a lot of Wordpress features. Also, as per the client requirements, it has to be <em>pretty</em>. That actually rules out quite a few themes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/86.jpg' height='794' width='1012'><div class='caption'>Click on a thumbnail to see a preview of the theme in action (you can even click on links and stuff in the preview). I like this theme called &ldquo;Platform.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s very clean, and very simple. Most themes will work just the same, so you should be able to pick any theme you want and be able to do the same sorts of things with it.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/87.jpg' height='796' width='1012'><div class='caption'>Click on the name of a theme you like, and then hit the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button to get a zip file with your new theme in it.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/88.jpg' height='432' width='791'><div class='caption'>Inside the zip file should be a folder called whatever your new theme is called. Just copy that folder to [whatever directory Wordpress is in]/wp-content/themes/ That&rsquo;s all you have to do to install a new theme! That&rsquo;s one of the reasons it&rsquo;s cool to set Wordpress up on your computer first, because installing themes and plugins is super easy.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/89.jpg' height='795' width='1021'><div class='caption'>Anyway, now if you go back to your Themes page, you should see your new theme under &ldquo;Available Themes.&rdquo; Click the little &ldquo;Activate&rdquo; link underneath it to, well, activate it.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/90.jpg' height='628' width='1032'><div class='caption'>Uh oh. I activated that &ldquo;Platform&rdquo; theme, and was greeted with a ton of errors. The site is covered with them too. What did I touch?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t plan on breaking Wordpress in this tutorial, but I&rsquo;m actually glad I did. A similar thing might very well happen to you at some point, and the best thing to keep in mind is to not panic. It&rsquo;s probably not your fault if the site gets broken, especially if you just installed a new theme or plugin. Chances are it was that theme or plugin what done it. The fact is that most of the themes and plugins for Wordpress aren&rsquo;t extremely well made. For example, the person who made this &ldquo;Platform&rdquo; theme seems to have gotten pretty lazy with how they&rsquo;re using classes in some of their files - and they haven&rsquo;t tested the theme with either PHP 5 or with the strict error reporting settings we&rsquo;re using - so it makes PHP have a bit of a crisis. If you see this sort of thing with the theme you picked, you could try to <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg' target='_blank'>debug</a> the code and figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with it, but it&rsquo;s probably best to just find a new theme to try. Welcome to the blunderful world of open source software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My site wasn&rsquo;t totally broken by this new theme, but yours very well could be by a theme you tried to install, so here&rsquo;s what you do if errors are making it so you can&rsquo;t get into the Dashboard at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/91.jpg' height='328' width='526'><div class='caption'>Head back to your themes folder ([whatever]/wp-content/themes) and find the folder for the theme that ruined everything. Rename (or just delete) it.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/92.jpg' height='87' width='349'><div class='caption'>Now you should be able to get into the Themes page, and you&rsquo;ll see this message. It can&rsquo;t find the theme files, because you renamed the folder they&rsquo;re in, so it just reverts to good old Twenty Eleven.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/93.jpg' height='807' width='1079'><div class='caption'>Anyway, this Lugada theme looks okay, too. Let&rsquo;s give it a shot. Same as before, I&rsquo;ll download it and stick it in my Themes folder.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/94.jpg' height='319' width='867'><div class='caption'>Success! Okay, so it&rsquo;s installed and running. Now we can customize it. Most themes allow some level of customization, so you can tweak images or colors to your liking. Actually, if you know CSS (the language designers use to style websites) you can tweak absolutely every aspect of a theme, because themes are almost entirely CSS.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/95.jpg' height='774' width='1079'><div class='caption'>Since this is a pretty minimal theme, there isn&rsquo;t much to customize. I can put in a Twitter ID or Facebook URL (not super useful), and I can add up to 5 images for a sliding banner thingie. I doubt that&rsquo;s going to suffice for what Alyson wants, but I&rsquo;ll take a look later when I upload some images.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/98.jpg' height='599' width='1046'><div class='caption'>Most themes will let you upload an image for the site header. Usually they will specify what size the header should be. In this case, it&rsquo;s 300 x 70 pixels.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/99.jpg' height='386' width='853'><div class='caption'>Alyson wanted a hand-written header, so I had her write her name out and then I scanned that into the computer. I had to crop it down to be the right size in Photoshop. You&rsquo;re on your own for making a logo. This is a website tutorial, not a logo tutorial.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/100.jpg' height='774' width='1082'><div class='caption'>In the Editor (Appearance - Editor) you can actually manipulate the stylesheets for the theme. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about CSS, you probably don&rsquo;t want to dig around this too much. Luckily, I know a lot about CSS, so I went in and tweaked some of the colors to match what Alyson wanted. I&rsquo;ll have to cover some basic CSS in an addendum or something, because it&rsquo;s just too much for this little Tutorial to bear.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/102.jpg' height='765' width='1156'><div class='caption'>Most themes allow customizable widgets, another powerful Wordpress tool. In the Widgets page you can drag and drop what widgets you want into the various sections that your theme provides. The theme I&rsquo;m using has a &ldquo;Main Sidebar&rdquo; section as well as two little spots in the footer. Most of the widgets are self-explanatory. Play around with these and find what works best for what you&rsquo;re looking to accomplish with your site.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/106.jpg' height='688' width='904'><div class='caption'>Now your site should have a bit more character to it. It&rsquo;s a bit barren, sure, but it should be starting to look cool.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re really getting a site together. You can spend a lot of time tweaking the theme and other settings, that&rsquo;s for sure. This is where it&rsquo;s handy to have it running right there on your own little Internet, because it will go super fast and you can mess with all of the files yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we&rsquo;ll look at creating pages and blog posts, and we&rsquo;ll do some more serious hands-on manipulation of the page layout. It&rsquo;s a time consuming process, and there are quite a few steps involved, but nobody said this was going to be easy. Well, okay, so I might have said that, but I didn&rsquo;t say it would be quick, did I? Well, we&rsquo;re almost at the finish line, so hang in there.</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>A website isn&rsquo;t really worth much without any content on it (unless you&rsquo;re like a Pinterest and you have millions of people all over to make your content for you). Right now, our little website may look kind of neat, but it&rsquo;s pretty much blank. Today we&rsquo;re going to do something about that. We&rsquo;ll create some new pages, make some blog posts, and upload some images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 C: Paging Dr. Wordpress</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Internet, content is displayed on things called &ldquo;web pages.&rdquo; Currently our little website has one page - we&rsquo;ll call it the Front Page. You haven&rsquo;t created this page, it&rsquo;s just the default page that Wordpress creates for you. It features a blog (which currently has no posts), but you can make it so your Front Page shows whatever you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time to get some content up in there. This is where you need to refer back to your little game plan, so you are clear about how many pages you need to create. For my website, I want to create five pages (Home, Bio, CV, Work, and Blog). I want the front page to be &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t want the blog to show up there. Chances are you&rsquo;ll have a similar concept for your site (you might have more or less pages, but I definitely recommend that you include at least an &ldquo;about&rdquo; or &ldquo;contact&rdquo; page or whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/107.jpg' height='644' width='935'><div class='caption'>You can create pages in the Pages section of the Dashboard. I know, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to wrap your brain around that idea, but you&rsquo;ll just have to manage. Note that I already have one page (and you probably do, too): the Sample Page which I threw mercilessly in the trash.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/108.jpg' height='641' width='1003'><div class='caption'>Hit &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; to add a page. The page Title will show up as a link in your site&rsquo;s top navigation (or however the theme you chose lists your pages). You can use Wordpress&rsquo;s&rsquo; really handy text editor panel to create the actual content for the page. You can use the &ldquo;Visual&rdquo; tab to format your text just like you would in any text editing program and Wordpress will generate some HTML for you, or you can switch to the &ldquo;HTML&rdquo; tab to insert HTML code yourself. You can also format it in the Visual tab and switch to the HTML tab to see what the HTML looks like, which can be interesting.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/109.jpg' height='641' width='1004'><div class='caption'>So I filled out the info for my &ldquo;Home&rdquo; page. You can modify the Permalink to this page if you want, but keeping it yourwebsite/index.php/pagetitle/ is probably the best way to go. If you want a page to be the Front page (as I do for &ldquo;Home&rdquo;), you will be able to make it so in a bit, so just hold your horses. You can preview the page or save it for later, but you can just go ahead and hit &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; to make it a real page.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/110.jpg' height='635' width='1002'><div class='caption'>Now if you check out your site, you&rsquo;ll see a new page in your site menu (for my theme, as for most themes, the site menu is right under the header logo). Yes, I want to change the colors of those links from Green to some sort of Red, but let&rsquo;s not worry about that now. Note that it treats your page like a blog post, so readers can post comments on them by default. I don&rsquo;t want that, so I&rsquo;ll have to turn it off, but we&rsquo;ll get to that later. Oh, and don&rsquo;t worry about that &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button (if there is one for you - it depends on your theme). That&rsquo;s just there because we&rsquo;re logged in as the Admin. Most users won&rsquo;t see that.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/112.jpg' height='638' width='1000'><div class='caption'>I can just say &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; again to add the next page. Once you have pages, you can make new pages as &ldquo;Sub Pages&rdquo; by selecting a Parent. You can use this to make a page like &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; as a sub-menu item from &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; if you want, for example. Themes handle the sub items differently, but most will have a little drop down menu that shows up when you hover over a menu item. You might have noticed that when you were browsing themes - this is how you set that up. Also take note of the order option, because this determines the order your links will show up on the menu. The first page should be &ldquo;0&rdquo; and then they go up from there.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/111.jpg' height='635' width='1002'><div class='caption'>You can select &ldquo;Set featured image&rdquo; near the bottom of the right side of the Page Editor to add an image to the page. I&rsquo;m going to upload a picture of Alyson for her Bio page. You could just copy an image directly to your /wp-content/uploads folder, but it&rsquo;s better to use Wordpress to do it, as it will format it properly and include it in a special &ldquo;Media Library&rdquo; that you can use anywhere on your site.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/113.jpg' height='639' width='1002'><div class='caption'>You can change the title for the image, where it links to when you click on it, and how it&rsquo;s aligned on the page. Once you insert the image, you can click on it and click the &ldquo;Edit Image&rdquo; button to tweak it further. It can be a little tricky to get the alignment to work right, but Hopefully you&rsquo;ll work it out. You might notice that you can&rsquo;t select a different &ldquo;Size&rdquo; option when you upload a new image to a post. This is because we haven&rsquo;t enabled image editing support in PHP. We&rsquo;ll get into that later, but for now you&rsquo;ll just have to resize the images yourself (you can do that in Paint) or use the &ldquo;Edit Image&rdquo; button after you&rsquo;ve inserted the image to resize it in HTML.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/114.jpg' height='641' width='1005'><div class='caption'>I created pages for all of the pages I need to create, and got them all ordered properly.

Notice that the Front Page (Home) doesn&#039;t have a permalink, anymore, because it&#039;s just &ldquo;localhost:81.&rdquo; We had better do something about that &ldquo;no blog entries&rdquo; thing, though.</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 D: Rad Blogojevich</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/119.jpg' height='701' width='1003'><div class='caption'>Manage your posts in the Posts section of the Dashboard.

This is a cool feature, because you can upload a huge picture and it will resize it to an appropriate size. You don&rsquo;t want to make users download huge images, because it will just be slow and obnoxious for no reason. The problem is that this function relies on an extension to PHP that we didn&rsquo;t activate when we first set up PHP. Do you really need this? Not really, because you&rsquo;ll have it when you deploy your site to any web server (almost definitely). Any images you want to upload in the meantime you can just resize manually, with Paint or whatever. However, if you really want to use it, I&rsquo;ll show you how. It&rsquo;s really easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/121.jpg' height='526' width='716'><div class='caption'>You have to dig up your good old &ldquo;php.ini&rdquo; file, which is in C:/php, in case you forgot.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/122.jpg' height='531' width='765'><div class='caption'>Find the line &ldquo;;extension=php_gd2.dll&rdquo; which is in the Dynamic Extensions section.

Just blast it up to like 100M (the M is for Megabytes) or something silly like that. There&rsquo;s no reason why your local testing environment should have a limit to uploaded files. You&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to upload an image file larger than 100 MB, so that will be more than enough.

Give the picture a title and a caption if you want. By default the image will link to itsself, so when a user clicks on the picture they&rsquo;ll just get the picture again. I think this is kind of silly, so unless I want it to link to something, I just click &ldquo;none&rdquo; for Link URL. If you did that PHP thing just now, you&rsquo;ll be able to specify what size to resize the image to. Notice that the original (Full) size is 1341 x 1614, which is really big for a web picture, so I&rsquo;ll resize to the default Medium size image (those sizes are adjustable in the Dashboard Settings). You can make it the featured image if you want - some Wordpress themes can use the featured images as thumbnails for the post - or just insert it into the post.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/129.jpg' height='412' width='291'><div class='caption'>You can hit &ldquo;Add New Category&rdquo; under Categories to assign this (or any post) to a new category besides &ldquo;Uncategorized.&rdquo; You can also make a category a subcategory to another category by using the dropdown box there.

There are still some weird things that we don&rsquo;t really want here or there, and there&rsquo;s no setting for them in the Dashboard. What do we do? Looks like we&rsquo;re going to have to get a bit more serious with Wordpress&rsquo;s&rsquo; beeps and boops.

      "text": "\n\n<h5>Part 5 E: Getting Our Hands Dirty</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Wordpress has plenty of settings for changing different things. However, there&rsquo;s a limit to what you can tweak with checkboxes and dropdowns. The real power of Wordpress lies in the fact that it&rsquo;s all built in PHP, which you can completely rewrite if you wanted to. Oh, stop sweating - we aren&rsquo;t going to rewrite anything, but we will be doing some serious haxxxx.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E A: The ABC&rsquo;s of PHP&rsquo;s</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I just want to go over some basic stuff about how PHP works, just so you have a bit of an understanding of what we&rsquo;re going to do. If you went through that PHP primer tutorial I linked a few parts back, good for you. This will be review for you. Otherwise, this will be wild and crazy. WOOAAAHHHH!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E A A: Where the Compiled things are</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>So PHP files are just text files, except they end with a .php instead of a .txt. For all intents and purposes, a PHP file is the same thing as an HTML file, so they can (and usually do) have a lot of HTML tags and whatnot in them as well as PHP code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PHP code goes inside of its own special tags, which are: &lt;?php and ?&gt;. If you&rsquo;re looking for some PHP code, look for those thingies, because anything in between them (spanning multiple lines, even) will be PHP. Also, if you want to add any code or whatever, you better make sure it&rsquo;s inside those guys, or you will not get what you&rsquo;re wanting to get.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E A B: No Comment</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When you make computer code, you&rsquo;re just working with text files. Then a computer takes that text and turns it into beeps and boops that it can do stuff with. You can include parts in your code that the computer will ignore, in case you want to leave little messages to future programmers (or yourself). Those are called &ldquo;comments.&rdquo; You can use them to make sections of code no longer work, which can be pretty handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments in PHP take one of two forms. A double slash (&ldquo;//&rdquo;) in front of a line means that anything on that line after the slashes will be ignored. A slash and an asterisk (&ldquo;/* . . . */&rdquo;) can surround comments as well, and everything in between the asterisks - even multiple lines - will be ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main things we will be doing will be commenting out sections of the PHP code in our Theme files, so that certain things will be removed. It&rsquo;s a way of removing code without actually removing code, so you can easily undo your changes just be removing the comment thingies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that comments will not &ldquo;get rid&rdquo; of the special PHP tags (&lt;?php or ?&gt;), so don&rsquo;t worry about having to &ldquo;unhide&rdquo; them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E A C: Good Luck, and Don&rsquo;t Fuck it Up</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>PHP is pretty complicated, especially within Wordpress. Unless you know about classes and objects and PHP, don&rsquo;t mess around too much, because you will break something. If you want to change something in a theme file, make a copy of the line you&rsquo;re changing, and comment out the original. That way you can revert your change easily enough if it causes problems. If all else fails, you can just delete your theme folder (inside wp-content in your web site directory), and start over again. All of the settings you made within Wordpress will still be there (your pages and whatnot), just your theme will be reset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E B: Pressing Dr. Pageword</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in, shall we?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/132.jpg' height='816' width='993'><div class='caption'>By default most themes treat pages the same as blog posts. This may be okay for some people, but I don&rsquo;t like it. We&rsquo;re going to change it. I&rsquo;ll remove the comments as well as the entire left column from every page. Sure, some themes will let you change page layouts on individual pages, but most don&rsquo;t. This is how you deal with those.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/133.jpg' height='810' width='991'><div class='caption'>Head to your Dashboard, and find the &ldquo;Editor&rdquo; page of the &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; section. This is where you can dig into your theme&rsquo;s underpants, as it were. You&rsquo;ll see a big text box where some code is, and a list of all the files in the theme along the right side. You can also edit themes that aren&rsquo;t the active theme, if you want, by using the little dropdown there at the top.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/134.jpg' height='755' width='1058'><div class='caption'>I want to edit the Page Template, so I found &ldquo;Page Template&rdquo; (page.php) from the list and selected it. This brings up the theme&rsquo;s page.php file (almost every theme will have the page.php template) into the text box. This is the code that specifies how pages are made in your theme. </div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/135.jpg' height='512' width='863'><div class='caption'>Most of the components of Wordpress are called with functions. For example, the &ldquo;get_header()&rdquo; function (usually) at the top of every file brings in the Theme&rsquo;s header, including the menu and whatever else. I want to find the function called &ldquo;comments_template()&rdquo; somewhere in this file, because that&rsquo;s the function that brings in the comments. It has a couple parameters, which you can find out more about by selecting it in that little &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; dropdown and hitting &ldquo;lookup.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/136.jpg' height='512' width='725'><div class='caption'>All I have to do is comment out that function, and it will be ignored when somebody tries to view a page. Adding two little slashes (&ldquo;/&rdquo;) before the function is all it takes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/137.jpg' height='756' width='1144'><div class='caption'>So I hit &ldquo;update file&rdquo; and refreshed the tab with the site in it. Check it out, no more comments! Depending on how much PHP (and CSS) you know, making any edits to Wordpress is that easy. That&rsquo;s why Wordpress is so great.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/138.jpg' height='421' width='712'><div class='caption'>Back in the Dashboard, I want to now find the function called &ldquo;get_sidebar()&rdquo; which is the function that creates the sidebar on the page. This will be a bit more complicated, because since the function is surrounded by that HTML Div tag, I can&rsquo;t just comment out the function.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/139.jpg' height='755' width='1129'><div class='caption'>This is why. The content within the sidebar is gone, but the sidebar itself (that HTML Div tag) and all of the associated styling are still there. My page content is still pushed over, but now it&rsquo;s even stupider looking because there&rsquo;s just a big empty space.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/140.jpg' height='423' width='708'><div class='caption'>So to get rid of the HTML tag, I have to use an HTML comment. They work just like the other type of PHP comment (/*...*/), but they use &ldquo;&lt;!--&rdquo; and &ldquo;--&gt;&rdquo; instead. If I throw a &ldquo;&lt;!--&rdquo; before the tag and a &ldquo;--&gt;&rdquo; after it, it will be like that tag never existed. I&rsquo;ll also leave that PHP function commented out, because those PHP tags will not be ignored even though they&rsquo;re still inside the comment. There&rsquo;s no reason to make the server do extra work for something we don&rsquo;t even want to see.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/143.jpg' height='674' width='1046'><div class='caption'>So there we . . . ah, crap. Okay, so we got rid of the other column, but this one is still hanging out wherever it wants. Looks like we&rsquo;ll have to dig into the CSS a bit, too.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/144.jpg' height='631' width='870'><div class='caption'>How can I figure out what to look for in the CSS file? It&rsquo;s a bit tricky to wrap your head around all those HTML tags and CSS properties, but there are handy tools to help you do that. In Chrome (or Safari or Firefox), you can hit &ldquo;Control + Shift + i&rdquo; to open the developer tools for the current page. Now you can get a little view of the structure of the page (you&rsquo;ll have to hit the little HTML button in Firefox), and you can click on the different elements in that list to highlight them in the actual page. It&rsquo;s an easy way to relate the HTML code to what you actually see on the page, and then you can pretty easily figure out that (in the case of my theme) this &ldquo;&lt;div class='column-content'&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&rdquo; is the main content area.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/145.jpg' height='668' width='1009'><div class='caption'>Here it is in Firefox. Where it says class=&rdquo;column-content&rdquo; is how the CSS styles are applied to it. That &ldquo;column-content&rdquo; class is set to be less than the entire width of the window, which is great if you have another column, but we don&rsquo;t, so we need to make it be the full width.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/146.jpg' height='668' width='1043'><div class='caption'>I went to the Stylesheet in the Theme Editor (my theme only has one, but yours might have more - you&rsquo;ll just have to look through them to find the one you need) and searched for &ldquo;column-content&rdquo; (Control+F will let you search the page for something). We can&rsquo;t just edit that style, because it will screw up the Blog page, which uses the same styles. We&rsquo;ll just have to create a new one.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/147.jpg' height='423' width='708'><div class='caption'>Select the style (including everything between the curly brackets - and throw in the curly brackets too) and copy it. Then paste that code right after the original. You can then rename the new style something else, like &ldquo;.column-solo&rdquo; (the period in front of the name is really important, make sure you keep it). Get rid of the margin, change the float to &ldquo;left&rdquo; and add width: 100% to the end of this new style. Make sure every line ends with a semicolon. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to search the page for the name of your new class. Hit &ldquo;Control+F&rdquo; and type your class name into the search box. You just want to make sure the new class doesn&rsquo;t already exist - it could cause huge problems if it does. Class names have to be unique. When you&rsquo;re ready, press &ldquo;Update File.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/148.jpg' height='452' width='626'><div class='caption'>Now I&rsquo;ll head back to the Page Template and find that Div tag.

Sure, it would look a lot better with a bit more content there, but that&rsquo;s an easy thing to do now. Now I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of that search box up there in the header. Most themes have something like that, and I don&rsquo;t really see a reason for it. We should be able to remove it pretty easily, now that we know all about commenting out a bit of PHP, right? Let&rsquo;s try it.</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 E C: What Else?</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/150.jpg' height='671' width='1046'><div class='caption'>The header is built by the header.php file in your theme, if you can believe it. We can scroll down a bit to find something talking about search. Sure enough, here&rsquo;s a couple HTML tags with a PHP function called &ldquo;get_search_form()&rdquo; inside it. Since these things are off to the right side of the page, we should be able to remove them much more easily than the sidebar was.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/151.jpg' height='419' width='621'><div class='caption'>Throw a few comments in there, and we should be good to go.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/152.jpg' height='679' width='1051'><div class='caption'>Oh yeah! Nothing is safe from our commenting hammer, now! Oh, but what about those menu colors, what if I wanted them to be red instead of green? It just so happens that changing colors is pretty easy in CSS . . .</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/153.jpg' height='678' width='1152'><div class='caption'>First we&rsquo;ll have to use the developer tools to find the HTML behind that button. Then we can see the CSS that&rsquo;s applied to it. We want to find the CSS style which looks like &ldquo;#topmenu ul li.current_page_item a&rdquo; and our color is in there.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/154.jpg' height='672' width='1051'><div class='caption'>I&rsquo;ll head over to the style.css file and search for that. There we can see that the color style is set to &ldquo;#8FC73E&rdquo; which might look like some crazy gibberish, but it&rsquo;s actually a color, represented in Hexadecimal format.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/155.jpg' height='669' width='1045'><div class='caption'>You can work with colors in Hex format in Photoshop, or you can try to find colors in Hex format online. I like this service called COLOURlovers, which can find you an entire color pallette based on one color. It&rsquo;s a good place to find colors, and get their Hexadecimal format for use on Internets.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/156.jpg' height='672' width='1047'><div class='caption'>Anyway, once you get a color you like, you can just find every instance of the color you want to replace and then replace it. Usually a theme will use the same few colors over and over in a lot of places, so you can just replace every instance of the color with another one and you&rsquo;ll be able to get all the colors switched. There were quite a few instances of that green color in my theme, but I made them all a sort of pinkish purple, which is more to Alyson&rsquo;s liking. </div>\r\n\r\n<p>Take great precaution when dealing with CSS stuff. There&rsquo;s a lot to consider about colors in a website, so be careful when you&rsquo;re changing them around all a-willy and a-nilly. You have to deal with mouseover states, active states, inactive states, borders, backgrounds, and lots of other stuff. I&rsquo;m not saying you shouldn&rsquo;t give it a shot, I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s a can of worms. You can use comments in CSS, just like PHP, using the /* . . . */ method, so put those around old properties when you change them, so you can more easily changes things back.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/157.jpg' height='669' width='1043'><div class='caption'>With just a bit of CSS and PHP tweaking, you can really whip that website into shape. Sure, it can be intimidating and complicated, but it can also be really fun and rewarding.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So with just a little bit of technical knowhow, we can remove or change some things on our site. But what if we want to add more features that aren&rsquo;t there at all? For that, we&rsquo;ll need some plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 5 F: Check out those Sweet Plugs</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/158.jpg' height='671' width='1043'><div class='caption'>Themes are great, but plugins are even greater. Head to the Plugins section of the dashboard to see your plugins. My Wordpress came with two, neither of which are activated. You can check those out if you want, but I&rsquo;m going to show you how to install a new one.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/159.jpg' height='673' width='1045'><div class='caption'>If you want Wordpress to do something that it doesn&rsquo;t do, you can google &ldquo;Wordpress plugin&rdquo; and whatever you want to do, and chances are you&rsquo;ll find something useful. Alyson wants an image gallery on her site, so I want to find a good image gallery plugin.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/160.jpg' height='678' width='1046'><div class='caption'>That led me directly to this official Wordpress Plugin Directory page for a decent looking Gallery plugin. You could also just search the Plugin Directory for a plugin, but whatever. Here you can see installation instructions, screenshots, and other information about plugins. You can also press that &ldquo;Download Version Whatever&rdquo; button to download it, so I&rsquo;ll go ahead and do that.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/161.jpg' height='545' width='763'><div class='caption'>Installing a plugin is just like installing a theme.

That way works really well when the site is located right there on your computer, but there&rsquo;s another easy way to install plugins which you can use even when your site is published to a web host out there in the Internet somewhere.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/163.jpg' height='674' width='977'><div class='caption'>Go to that Plugins page, click &ldquo;add new&rdquo; and then select &ldquo;Upload.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/164.jpg' height='678' width='980'><div class='caption'>Point it directly to the zip file you downloaded with the plugin inside it. Yes, just hand it the zip file, and it will do everything on its own. You can install plugins either way, it really makes no difference, but keep in mind that when the site is live you&rsquo;ll have to do it this way.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/165.jpg' height='677' width='981'><div class='caption'>Okay, so the plugin is installed. Now you just have to activate it (click &ldquo;Activate&rdquo;) and it will be listed in the &ldquo;Active&rdquo; section of the plugins page. In my case, for this image gallery plugin, I also got another section in the Dashboard menu - &ldquo;Gallery.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where I can create image galleries with this plugin.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/166.jpg' height='671' width='1020'><div class='caption'>Inside this new Gallery section, I can control just about every aspect of an image gallery.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/167.jpg' height='675' width='1087'><div class='caption'>The plugin also added a new button to the page / blog post editing window. I can use this button to insert a gallery into a page or blog post. Your plugin might have added a button here as well.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Plugins do all kinds of things, so your experience may be totally different. I won&rsquo;t go into detail about how to use this particular gallery plugin, as it&rsquo;s outside the scope of &ldquo;How to Make a Website.&rdquo; There is one plugin that I would like to show you, though, and I recommend that you install it. It will help prevent spam robots and jerk-wads from wreaking havoc with your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/168.jpg' height='676' width='1088'><div class='caption'>Head to <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/' target='_blank'>http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/</a> and download the plugin there.

If you don&rsquo;t have a Google account, you might as well crawl out from under that rock and create one. Enter &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; into the box and hit &ldquo;Create Key.&rdquo; Note that you&rsquo;ll have to get new keys for your actual domain name when you publish your website to your host.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/171.jpg' height='724' width='1084'><div class='caption'>Now you can go back to your reCAPTCHA options and enter the Public and Private keys into those text boxes.

It will help keep out robots and stuff.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/173.jpg' height='725' width='1081'><div class='caption'>Now you can go to your discussion settings page and make things a bit less complicated for your users. I like to turn off &ldquo;Comment author must have a previously approved comment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Comment Author must fill out name and e-mail.&rdquo; The former option makes it so you have to manually approve every comment on your site (which takes time and is annoying to both you and your commenters) and the latter makes it so users can&rsquo;t post comments anonymously. Sure, I wish people would be more open about who they are on the Internet, but you can&rsquo;t force people to do anything they don&rsquo;t want to do.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/174.jpg' height='843' width='1115'><div class='caption'>So now you (probably) have a super cool, totally customized website.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing beyond your grasp now, so long as it&rsquo;s within the - admittedly vast - purview of Wordpress. I invite you to spend a bit of time now really polishing the bits here and there. Go over all your text, check all your pictures, and make sure there aren&rsquo;t any typos or bugs. Play around with a few plugins and see what sorts of cool features you can wrangle out of your new site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have one step left in this whole process, and it&rsquo;s the big one. Next time we&rsquo;ll publish your whole site to the Wild World of Web, and after that it will be out there for the whole world to see. After that, you can still make changes and whatnot, but it won&rsquo;t be quite as easy as when it&rsquo;s right there on your computer. If there&rsquo;s anything else you want to do, do it now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I understand, of course, that there are some things you might have trouble with. Some of that PHP and CSS stuff can get really troublesome. I would be happy to answer any questions that I can. Feel free to hit me up at <a href='mailto:smcgill@denyconformity.com' target='_blank'>smcgill@denyconformity.com</a> and tell me what your site is all about, and what you&rsquo;re having trouble with - or what questions you have about PHP, HTML, CSS, or just life in general. I want the Internet to be a better place, and I&rsquo;m willing to do that one website at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, for the exciting conclusion!</p>\n\n",

The time has finally come to put that puppy online and be an Internetman just like me. Without further adieu, let&rsquo;s make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 6: The Epic Conclusion</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to download and install an FTP program - okay, you can just use Windows if you want, but this program will make things much easier. My favorite is called Filezilla, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be using.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/175.jpg' height='705' width='1028'><div class='caption'>Head to <a href='http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client' target='_blank'>http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client</a> and click the green &ldquo;Download Now&rdquo; button. Then you just have to wait for the download to start. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to click anything else. You&rsquo;ll get a plain old .exe file, so just run that and install the thing. &ldquo;FTP&rdquo; stands for File Transfer Protocol, and it&rsquo;s the main way to upload files to Internets. Filezilla makes that process pretty easy.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two components to deploying our website. First we have to set up MySQL, and then we have to upload the files. You better dig out that email you got from your web host with all the information you need to access your new space. We&rsquo;ll do the database first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Part 6 A: I Referred to it as <em>Our</em> SQL</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/how_to_website/176.jpg' height='704' width='1045'><div class='caption'>Remember phpMyAdmin?

Most basic web hosts use this control panel system called cPanel, which gives you links to all of the features included in your account. If your control panel looks different than this, well, I&rsquo;m sorry. You&rsquo;ll just have to find your way on your own, but it should still have options for doing everything I&rsquo;m going to do with cPanel.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You might notice that Bluehost has a link in the control panel to automatically install Wordpress onto your web space. This might be pretty easy, but it doesn&rsquo;t offer nearly as much control over things as the way we&rsquo;re doing it, so just ignore it.

Sometimes for strange reasons some files will get chewed up when they are uploaded. This is extremely rare, but it happens. If your site is totally broken and you can&rsquo;t even get into /wp-admin, you could try uploading the site again with a different FTP program or Windows itself (<a href='http://www.ncsu.edu/resnet/file_transfer/ftp-windows-explorer.php' target='_blank'>here</a> is a quite old but still relevant tutorial on using FTP in Windows).

      "text": "\n\n<p>My birthday is this Saturday. I&rsquo;m going to be 26 years old. I&rsquo;m having a harder and harder time justifying asking my friends and family to buy me toys this year. The problem is that aside from a new $5000 camera or a new $600 camera lens, there isn&rsquo;t really much that I necessarily want or need, and I can&rsquo;t really ask my parents to buy me a $5000 camera when I&rsquo;m not really doing anything productive with the camera I have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been perusing Amazon.com for some stuff that I can ask for my birthday this year. I know this is pretty late notice, but with Amazon Prime you can get free 2-day shipping on most stuff, so if you wanted to get me any of this stuff you probably still could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the idea here is to find some stuff that an Adult could get. Obviously I would love to have a new Nerf Gun or a Lego or something, but that&rsquo;s kid stuff. I&rsquo;m an adult, now, which means it&rsquo;s time for me to start getting into adult pursuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Item:</strong> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00362MKUC/ref=s9_simh_gw_p21_d0_g21_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-5&amp;pf_rd_r=196T5GV6CP1RFEYCPP1T&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470939291&amp;pf_rd_i=507846' target='_blank'>Hot Dog Hat</a>, by US Toy</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_hat.jpg' height='505' width='507'><p><strong>Product Description:</strong> &ldquo;Catch attention with this funny hat. This hot dog hat is great for a ball game or to wear on funny hat day. Adult size. Made of cloth. Size 18 L.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so this might seem like a kid thing. How many adults do you know who would wear a hot dog hat? Make no mistake, though, this is Adult size, so it is RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. I love hot dogs, and I love catching attention. This is pretty much made just for me. I absolutely can&rsquo;t wait to wear this to a ball game so the guy behind me will have this hilarious hat in his way through the whole game. I also - wait a minute - <em>there&rsquo;s a funny hat day?</em> Why did nobody tell me about funny hat day? I WOULD ROCK THE CRAP OUT OF FUNNY HAT DAY. Especially with this hat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part? You don&rsquo;t have to worry about this hot dog going bad (do hot dogs actually go bad?). It&rsquo;s made of cloth!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual best part is looking at the &ldquo;Customers who bought this item also bought&rdquo; section on the Hot Dog Hat&rsquo;s amazon page:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_customersalso.jpg' height='240' width='1103'><p>No, these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;related items.&rdquo; This is real stuff that people have actually purchased in addition to Hot Dog Hat. There is a man out there (of course he is a man) who owns the triple threat of Hot Dog Hat, Hamburger Hat, and Pizza Hat. That man is my hero, and he is the true champion of Funny Hat Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_boughttogether.jpg' height='194' width='627'><div class='caption'>Oh, thank you, Internet.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amazon.com Rating:</strong> 2.5 Stars (3 reviews)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where Hot Dog Hat kind of loses some of its appeal. Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AOLCKPYFFQMNU/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>Idaho Dave</a> (you owe it to yourself to click that link) says, &ldquo;NOT ADULT SIZE. KIDS ONLY... SMALL HEADS ONLY... CHEAPLY MADE WITH MUSTARD FALLING OFF.&rdquo; (one star). I mean, as long as the Ketchup stays on, I think I can deal with it. Still, though, what is the point of buying an Adult size Hot Dog Hat if it is only for, as Idaho Dave also puts it, &ldquo;AMAZON TRAVELERS WITH SHRUNKEN HEADS!&rdquo; However, as Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ARGTORKW5T3CC/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>Peter J. Dibonaventura</a> (in his only Amazon.com review) points out, &ldquo;they do squeeze your head a little- but the good news is THEY stay ON!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a pretty good point, Peter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe Hot Dog Hat isn&rsquo;t the best choice, though. I mean, it&rsquo;s only $7.23, but I really need the mustard to stay on for the joke to really land. Maybe there&rsquo;s another Hot Dog Hat on Amazon that&rsquo;s better.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_results.jpg' height='56' width='190'><div class='caption'>Oh, good.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame about Hamburger Hat, though. It only has one review, from Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1IL95JV5QUODY/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>June L. Smithee</a>. She says, &ldquo;I wear food hats for work at a school for young children. They like the fact that I&#039;m silly enough to wear them. This one is great for what I wanted it for, [Amazon.com] ask if it is a fun toy, durable toy, educational toy but this is a hat not a toy, just for fun.&rdquo; (One star). Come on, June, you&rsquo;ve singlehandedly destroyed the reputation of this fine novelty hat, just because Amazon.com doesn&rsquo;t have a sepparate category for Novelty Hats?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously this Novelty Hat market is a pandora&rsquo;s box of possibilities, but let&rsquo;s not get mired in deciding which one will be best for funny hat day or which one has the most durable mustard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That hat really has me thinking about hot dogs, though. Man, I love hot dogs. Maybe there&rsquo;s something on Amazon.com for me? I mean, something besides a giant novelty hot dog (made of cloth) that I can wear on my head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Item:</strong> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Nostalgia-Electrics-RHD-800-Series-Roller/dp/B000XB6LS6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337193696&amp;sr=8-3' target='_blank'>Nostalgia Electrics RHD-800 Retro Series Hot Dog Roller</a>, by Nostalgia Electrics</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_roller.jpg' height='676' width='665'><p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to recreate that real 7-Eleven experience of eating a lukewarm hot dog that&rsquo;s been sitting out all day having people sneeze on it. The only problem that I forsee with this bad boy is that I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able to figure out those complicated controls. I mean, &ldquo;OFF - ON&rdquo; I understand (though I don&rsquo;t understand why the knob seems to be halfway between the two), but what is that &ldquo;MIN - MAX&rdquo; dial for? Does it control the amount of food poisoning that the RHD-800 applies to the hot dogs slowly rotating away to oblivion on it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Description:</strong> &ldquo;The old fashioned hot dog roller with griddle brings back memories of carnivals, ball games; family gatherings and more. The unit holds up to eight regular sized hot dogs or 4 foot long hot dogs at a time. Includes convenient bun storage warmer in the canopy top. This hot dog stand is a fun way for guests to select and make their own hot dogs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally I&rsquo;ll have something for my &ldquo;select your own hot dog&rdquo; parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amazon Rating:</strong> 3.8 Stars (39 reviews)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reviews are pretty evenly spread for the RHD-800. Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1NXBSYO96ZQN5/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>ZipSmoke20</a> lauds the RHD-800&rsquo;s easy cleanup (presumably because the filthier it is the more authentic it is) and its ability to make &ldquo;perfectly cooked dogs&rdquo; (5 stars). He says, &ldquo;We run the left knob at 5 o&#039;clock and in 20-25 minutes you&#039;ll have a nice evenly cooked hot dog with perfect color and perfect temperature inside. We&#039;ve cooked more than 100 hot dogs on this unit since my purchase less than a month ago, unit is still going strong with zero issues. . . If you are even a little interested in this item don&#039;t hesitate, order one, you won&#039;t regret it.&rdquo; The dude is a hot dog FIEND. I don&rsquo;t know if I would say I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;little interested&rdquo; but it sounds like a sure thing. Wait - <em>20 - 25 minutes?! I&rsquo;m not waiting 25 minutes for a hot dog.</em> I could make a real food in that much time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a flip side to that coin, of course. Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A9BFPSMC0PTKV/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp' target='_blank'>Michelle A. Kinsey</a>, in her only Amazon.com review, bought the RHD-800 as a Birthday gift for someone (so I&rsquo;m totally looking in the right place). Michelle&rsquo;s friend was &ldquo;sure she was going to give up her day job and run a hot-dog stand, Perfect gift to get her started.&rdquo; Hey, maybe I could start a hot-dog stand! Michelle goes on to tell a sad (albeit somewhat lyrical) tale. She actually has quite a way with words. As she puts it, &ldquo;1st machine arrived she invited guest over to show her new stand, The roller would only go 1/4 of a turn and stop, Returned the machine for a new one. 2nd machine arrived guest invited for a card game and this new machine the rollers would not turn at all, 1 engineer, 1 contractor and 1 electrician and no rollers to cook the hot-dogs, Thank goodness for the stove. And a very disappointed Birthday girl. we decided we did not want to try our luck on a 3rd machine:(.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll just go ahead and post one more review, in its entirety, because of how great it is. It&rsquo;s from Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2E5V704BZ6J5D/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp' target='_blank'>Angelica Westry</a>, and the review is aptly entitled &ldquo;Angelica.&rdquo; Angelica says, &ldquo;TERRIABLE!!!! When I receive my Hotdog Roller it looked like someone took a hammer and smashed it!!!! It still works (Thank God) but it looks teriable, not at all what it says it looks like in the describstion. Very disapointing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey wait, Michelle brought up a good point. I can just cook hot dogs in the stove! Well, I don&rsquo;t need this teriable piece of junk, then!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe this idea to start my own Hot Dog stand isn&rsquo;t such a bad one, though. I mean, I don&rsquo;t have to limit myself to something teriable, I could put a bit more money up front to get something really nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Item:</strong> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Dog-Hotdog-Steamer-Merchandiser/dp/B004E231VK/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337193696&amp;sr=8-7' target='_blank'>The Dog Hut Hotdog Steamer and Merchandiser</a>, by Paragon</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/hotdog_paragon.jpg' height='508' width='455'><p>Now we&rsquo;re talking!

I want to Hot Dog Stand, and so I&rsquo;ll buy the Black Book of it. Plus, hey, you really can&rsquo;t beat that cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Description:</strong> &ldquo;The Hotdog industry is multi-billion dollar industry. Fact of the matter is that last year the American hot dog vendors collectively earned more revenues than most countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. Hotdogs are in big demand. This offers a real job security. With over 18 billion hot dogs sold every year just in the US. No doubt it is rightly called 'Recession Free' business. What is the difference between making $100 day and averaging $500 day? The answer is: knowledge. It is not experience, it is knowledge. The Black Book is the only book in the market which combines the experiences of top hot dog vendors from Seattle, New York and Chicago. These vendors are street fighters who learned how to top the competition.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey, Chicago, that&rsquo;s where I live! I&rsquo;ll turn myself into a down and dirty street fighter, blasting the competition with the most powerful hadouken of all: knowledge. Help me, Mat Chaundhry, to earn more revenues than those stupid countries in Africa. Take that, the Congo. Move over, Namibia. I&rsquo;ll make more money than both of you! I bet you could really use some of this insecticide and hoof conditioner, too. Too bad! I have a big demand to fill just in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hold on a second. The answer is: knowledge, right? It is not experience, it is knowledge. Why is this book the combined <em>experiences</em> of top hot dog vendors, then? Why would I want their useless, useless experiences when knowledge is the true answer? I&rsquo;m starting to have second thoughts about this. Also, there&rsquo;s this review, from freaking <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A71C047PYPUZJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>Alec Baldwin</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have to admit that I was skeptical that I could ever make a go of a business after my ' Oooh La Waffle-Gourmet French Creme-Filled Waffles' stands failed to turn a profit despite perfect locations (right across the street from the beach? One practically in the parking lot of the local Tennis Club? C&#039;mon!) and an initial investment of over $400,000. But I saw a copy of of this book on the counter of my favorite 'Street Meat Bistro', and although at first of course I thought it was porn, I asked the vendor if I could take a look. This is the book which takes your dream of selling low-cost/high profit margin meat and premium condiments, dangles it in front of your eyes and says 'Here it is....your dream is plump and hot....now reach for it!' In six months using techniques outlined in plain meat-vendor lingo, I was buying my second cart! Offering double the condiments and still turning a profit! I am not up to the 'Hundred Dollar A Day' mark the author assures me is possible, but I am well on my way to half of that. Not bad for less than ten hours in the fresh air in a not so snowy Detroit winter!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great book. Not as much of what we see on the cover as I would like, and not even a mention of how to distribute 'pharmaceuticals' discreetly from my cart to supplement the slow weeks (like another book I had read), but a great plan to make it rich in the low cost reheated processed meat biz.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could never hope to compete with freaking Alec Baldwin. He&rsquo;s totally on the money about that cover, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so a birthday just isn&rsquo;t the time or place to start a new career. I already have a career, making websites. What I really need is something to make my time working in a stuffy, boring office more interesting. Not just on funny hat day, but <em>every</em> day.

There was the time before somebody realized he could make realistic fake plastic poop, and there is the time after - the fake plastic poop age. These days, literally the only problem you face is deciding which of the hundreds of fake plastic poops out there is the fake plastic poop for you. Let&rsquo;s see how this one &ldquo;piles up,&rdquo; as it were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Description:</strong> &ldquo;Imagine the look on your girlfriend, friend, or wifes face when she walks in the bathroom and encounters this 'Load'. This fake poop provides hours of entertainment and horror!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hours of entertainment</em> is a lofty claim. My attention span has been so destroyed by TV and Video games that I can hardly bring myself to finish swallowing my hoof conditioner treatments. In order for something to give me hours of entertainment, it had better be really, really great. Still, I do have a lot of things I could place fake poop on, and my girlfriend does really hate looking at poop, so you&rsquo;d think the possibilities are pretty endless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.7 Stars (59 reviews)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real problem with fake plastic poop is that it&rsquo;s victim to the opinions of viewers. Some people might agree with Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2IBUE2WR08IBH/ref=cm_cr_dp_qtlb_pdp' target='_blank'>Craig Motsenboker</a> in saying, &ldquo;Overall this product is pootastic.&rdquo; Others might disagree, however, like Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2V7V6IPXDKKQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_qtlb_pdp' target='_blank'>S. Namfukwe</a>, who says, &ldquo;Looks very fake and very plastic.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s really going to be a crap shoot (sorry) whether or not you&rsquo;ll approve. It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether or not Amazon.com user  <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYLI58QD3VJ4L/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>MW</a> likes the product when he wrote a review entitled, &ldquo;crappy product.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the point?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you do, heed the warning of Amazon.com user <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1FDYEL18NEO2H/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp' target='_blank'>PizzaAttack</a>, whose review, &ldquo;Caution,&rdquo; is a very cautionary tale indeed. He says, &ldquo;This product was ok until Someone decided to replace it with the real thing. After the laughs I proceeded to collect my toy only to find the real thing in my hands. Still warm too. I suggest keeping a watchful eye on it.&rdquo; To be fair, when you prank you have to expect a bit of pranking back. Somebody got that guy pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That brings up a real problem with fake plastic poop, though. I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to prank somebody, why not just go for it? My body produces its own version of fake plastic poop which is, in my opinion, pretty pootastic. I could save myself quite a bit of money by just placing my own poop around to see the look on my girlfriend, friend, or wifes face. I mean, what&rsquo;s the prank, here? We&rsquo;re working entirely off the premise that it&rsquo;s funny just to make somebody look at a thing they kind of don&rsquo;t like to look at? Fake plastic poop is so ubiquitous now that it&rsquo;s not even really a prank anymore. This Someone in PizzaAttack&#039;s story might really be on to something, there. A real prank would be to make somebody think you placed fake plastic poop somewhere, but then have it turn out to be <em>real poop</em>. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> funny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Item:</strong> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/DOMAGRON-Novelty-780984463366-Fake-Stress/dp/B0054QV2A2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337186517&amp;sr=8-4' target='_blank'>Fake Poop Stress Toy</a>, by DOMAGRON Novelty</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/birthday_2012/fake_poop2.jpg' height='198' width='278'><p>It does look a bit like poop, but it looks an awful more like something else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Description:</strong> &ldquo;The Fake Poop Stress Toy is the perfect stress toy for when you feel like s***. You can squeeze this ridiculously realistic foam poop toy when you&#039;ve hit rock bottom. Just imagine what your co-workers will think when they see you squeezing poop. For a fun office prank, place the Fake Poop Stress Toy in a common place around the office. Your co-workers will be checking their shoes after seeing poop on the floor. It&#039;s time to have more fun at work with the Fake Poop Stress Toy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tell you what, it really <em>is</em> time to have more fun at work. I really applaud these guys for giving this thing a dual-purpose function. I mean, it eliminates stress and is a really, really great joke. Listen, nothing humiliates coworkers more than being tricked into checking their shoes. When they look down at their feet, they&rsquo;ll just be reminded about how poorly conditioned their hooves are in comparison to mine, so it&rsquo;s like two pranks in one. It&rsquo;s the perfect storm. I could basically sell my computer, TV, comic books, and anything else I use to entertain myself, because Fake Poop Stress Toy is all I&rsquo;ll ever need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got it.

      "title": "District Alpha: Chapter 7",
      "text": "\n\n<p>I&#039;ve been working on this book for quite a while now, and I&#039;m still very excited about how great it is. However, I&#039;m still waiting on some offers from some movie studios for the film rights. Just let me know when you&#039;re ready to make some fat stacks, movie studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, when last we left our really beautiful heroes, they were running for their lives through the streets of District Alpha, trying to get to a safe house where our hero Matt&#039;s friends lived. Our other hero, Kate, was just trying to get a handle on being in the big city, since she grew up on a robot farm.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone</h5>\r\n<h5>Chapter 7</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Exposition House,&rdquo; said the old man in the doorway, grinning from ear to ear at the two of them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good to meet you, Kate!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man had already given Matt a heartfelt greeting, but it&rsquo;s much more interesting to start this scene when the old man meets Kate. They were standing, the three of them, in a dark corridor of a large apartment building. The hall was very dark, and graffiti could be seen on the walls. Bright, warm light cascaded from the open door to Matt&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; apartment. It was very inviting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked at the man. He was small and only had hair around the back of his head. Kate had never met this kindly old man before, but his warm greeting made her immediately at ease. She had only met one physically old person in her life, many years ago, so she was fascinated by the lines on his face and the shine of his bald head. He stood aside in the entryway, gesturing grandly to the both of them, ushering them inside. Kate followed Matt inside, left speechless by this onslaught of new experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Kate is from District Delta.&rdquo; Matt filled the silence left by Kate&rsquo;s inexperience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man, whom Kate had just learned was called Pete, held his hand out to Kate, somehow smiling even larger than before. She stared at his wrinkled face and followed the line of his beliverspotted arm to his hand, held vertically with his fingers all pointing at her. She stared, confused, for what seemed like minutes before suddenly remembering the gesture that she had seen her father make to other gentlemen on the robot farm many years ago. With a flash of comprehension on her face, she brought her hand to his and wrapped her fingers around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking over at Matt, the old man said with a chuckle, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a naive one, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Pete, take it easy,&rdquo; Matt said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s been through a lot in the last few days.&rdquo; Matt reached out to gently pull their hands apart. Kate was happy to know how to shake the old man&rsquo;s hand, but she had no idea how or when to end such a gesture. She was very grateful for Matt&rsquo;s tactful interjection, and she smiled softly at his hand on hers. She would have preferred to shake his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re in safe hands, now, my dear!&rdquo; Pete said to her, his warm friendly face making her smile again. Kate was really displaying a broad range of subtle emotions, but they were all just smiles, so it&rsquo;s not like it was some really expensive Oscar winning moment or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man turned into the apartment with the same grand form with which he treated everything, saying, &ldquo;come, you&rsquo;ll have to meet the whole family!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked at her surroundings, now, as they stepped into a new corridor. They were now standing in a short hallway, softly lit by an overhead light. The walls were lined with pictures of many things Kate had never seen before, and many people Kate wanted to meet. The people in the pictures were all smiling. Kate marveled at all of the old photographs - some of them were so old that their hologromatic projection was starting to fade -  as Matt and Pete chatted. She hardly paid any attention to them. This corridor was a big contrast from the last few corridors they had gone through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Aunt Kathy and Uncle Tom are going to be so excited to see you,&rdquo; Pete was saying, putting his thin arm around Matt&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How is everyone?&rdquo; Matt asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pete started explaining that times were as rough as ever, but as they reached the end of the corridor they all stopped short at the sound of a high-pitched scream. Kate tensed up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Matt! Guy&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Matt!&rdquo; A young woman was shouting. The corridor opened up into a cozy kitchen, and just beyond Kate could see several figures inside a living room, all excitedly getting up and hurrying to where Pete and Matt were standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate could only stand and watch as what seemed like a thousand hugs and warm greetings descended upon her new friend. She felt awkward for the first time, in this new social situation she would never have dreamt of. She couldn&rsquo;t keep up with everyone speaking all at once, and she was surprised at the myriad ways each person used to say the same thing. If she had a thesaurus with her, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to come up with as many synonyms for &ldquo;good to see you&rdquo; as they had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the strangers&rsquo; eyes were turning on her. She felt more awkward at first, but these people were so friendly and their smiles were so inviting that she felt safe and decided to just go with it. These people really were friendly, you see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt looked at her and smiled. He said, &ldquo;this is Kate. She&rsquo;s my new friend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire room looked at her then. She smiled awkwardly back at them and lifted her hand in a little half-wave. Pete was all smiles. He has already met the new girl, so he was way ahead of everybody else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt began the introductions. Kate smiled and touched hands with everyone in the room. Some of them were introduced in pairs because they were married or something, but Kate still touched their hands separately. Kate knew she would never remember all of these new names and faces, but most of these people aren&rsquo;t major characters so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter who they are. She was able to tell who was important in the room because they were more attractive and had a few more things to say to her than just &ldquo;hello.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate met Matt&rsquo;s uncle Tom and aunt Kathy. Pete mentioned them earlier, so they&rsquo;ll probably be important to the story later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Kate met a girl named Alice. Alice was about Kate&rsquo;s age, but she seemed a lot smarter than Kate about stuff that Kate wasn&rsquo;t so smart about. Kate also really didn&rsquo;t like the way Alice was looking at Matt, but she also really didn&rsquo;t know why. Alice was really pretty, but in a different way than Kate. Alice was the Mila Kunis to Kate&rsquo;s Natalie Portman - but only as an example. Who could afford them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Kate met a really grumpy looking guy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem,&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not very important,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;so my whole part will probably get cut out of the movie entirely.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate didn&rsquo;t really understand that, as her furrowed brow implied. At least he got to say something in the book. The guy stepped back to his place and very deliberately milled about, conspicuously being inconspicuous. For example, he chatted with one of the other extra people in the room, but neither of them actually said anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally Kate met a man named Braiden. He owned the apartment they were all living in, which is only part of the reason she could tell he was a main character. He was also a Steve Buscemi looking guy, and those sorts are always really important. Braiden looked at her with his big, round eyes and welcomed her to his home. Kate was put off at first by Braiden&rsquo;s blatant un-attractiveness, but you know how Steve Buscemi is actually really endearing, especially when he&rsquo;s being a nice guy. He wore an olive-colored shirt, buttoned all the way to the collar even though he didn&rsquo;t have a tie. His olive-colored cargo pants were well worn, and he had lots of stuff in all of his pockets, including the two on the front of his shirt. His quaint little fedora hat was haphazardly placed on his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate met some other people there but they weren&rsquo;t important so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. They were just extra people. Eventually everybody - people with names and all the extras - filed out of the kitchen and went back to what they were doing. Braiden took Matt under his arm and they went into a back room. Kate felt alone for a moment, left to fend for herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked around at this part of the apartment. The kitchen was very nice, with cooking utensils stored all around the granite countertops. Kate noted that the appliances were all made by GE, and she could really tell that they were very high quality appliances. A long countertop separated the kitchen from the next room, which was a sort of living area. When she looked in that direction, she realized that two little girls were standing by the kitchen island, watching her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; one of the girls said. The other nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Kate replied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ashley,&rdquo; the girl said. The other nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. I&rsquo;m Kate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; The girls giggled. They had heard her name said a hundred times already. The two little girls wore pigtails and dresses with flowers on them. One of them was white, and the other was black, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter which was which. The important thing is that nobody is surprised when they show up on a movie screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;T!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate gasped in shock when the shout rang out to her side. She had forgotten that Pete was still standing there, and he was looking up at her with his customary smile. She had no idea what he meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make some tea!&rdquo; Pete elaborated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve never heard of tea.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She relaxed. &ldquo;Oh! Of course I&rsquo;ve heard of tea. I just didn&rsquo;t understand why you yelled it in my ear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor naive girl, you have a lot to learn about the city! Here, I&rsquo;ll put the kettle on and make you a cup of darjey. Tea&rsquo;s a bit different, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll love it if you try it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate sighed and decided that this old man wasn&rsquo;t all there. She shrugged and said, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked back at the two girls. They were still smiling and giggling as if they knew something Kate didn&rsquo;t. Kate might have wondered at that point if her fly was down, if automatic pants hadn&rsquo;t been invented many years earlier. They weren&rsquo;t giggling at anything in particular, though, that&rsquo;s just how kids are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you like Tv?&rdquo; the one girl asked Kate. The other nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure. We had a government-issue television on the robot farm. I used to watch it when I was your age.&rdquo; Kate replied. The gratuitous backstory was lost on the little girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want to watch with us?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Kate replied. She didn&rsquo;t have anything better to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girls ran off, giggling, to the living area, where a big comfy couch sat in front of a screen bigger than Kate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The TV on my farm wasn&rsquo;t nearly as big as this one,&rdquo; Kate said, staring at the giant screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the girls grabbed a remote and flipped the screen on. They started watching a television show or movie made by whatever production studio buys the movie rights to this book. It&rsquo;s a perfect cross promotional opportunity. Kate sat on the couch next to the girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly Pete walked into the living room carrying a steaming mug. He carefully handed it to Kate, who took a quick sip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here you are, young lady.&rdquo; Pete said as he sat in the easy chair that was right next to the couch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pete.&rdquo; Kate replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Watching some Tv?&rdquo; Pete asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. I haven&rsquo;t seen this show before.&rdquo; Kate replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, we only watch old shows here. We have a great collection. We don&rsquo;t watch the Government Tv.&rdquo; Kate realized that he was putting an emphasis on the T in Tv, which she figured was a city thing. Pete continued, &ldquo;all the programs are Mandated by the Government, you know. No creativity. No freedom. No Scott Bakula. Not like the good old days.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They sat there, sipping tea and watching a great collection of content from the early 2010&rsquo;s for quite a few minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally Pete leaned to Kate, and in a sort of mystical, hushed voice said, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re here for the prophecy?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked up at the old man. He was smiling gently, comfortingly, with a look that said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, your secret will be safe with me&rdquo; except that Kate didn&rsquo;t know what the Hell he was talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long pause happened then, during which Kate tried really hard to process what the old man had just said. Nothing was working out, though, so all she could say was, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The prophecy. You&rsquo;re the One, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Pete replied with a wink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really much of an elaboration, and it only raised more questions. She decided to choose the question that was in the forefront of her thoughts, which was, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some say it isn&rsquo;t true, of course, but now they&rsquo;ll believe. Now they&rsquo;ll have someone to put their faith in.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another pause. Another attempt for her brain to get a handle on things. Another &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pete smiled, and a bony old hand reached out to gently touch hers in a comforting manner. &ldquo;So Matt hasn&rsquo;t told you yet. Well, there&rsquo;s no harm in spilling the beans now, I suppose. You&rsquo;ll learn your destiny sooner or later. I probably don&rsquo;t need to tell you what everybody thinks of that Matt. He always was, you know.&rdquo; he said, kind of trailing off there at the end. He smiled to himself, lost in thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate was starting to freak out a little bit. &ldquo;What were you saying?&rdquo; she prompted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he&rsquo;s been with us quite a while, you know. That Braiden, he thinks Matt is -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, not about Matt. What is this prophecy?&rdquo; She interrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Pete could respond, Matt and Braiden came back into the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, Kate, let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Braiden said. The two of them stood there staring at her. She sat, mug of tea in hand, staring at Pete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally Pete leaned gently to her, and with a caring pat on her knee, said, &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re waiting for you to follow them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate slowly stood, eyes wide, careful not to drop her mug of hot tea. She walked over to Matt and Braiden, through a doorway into a room that Kate thought looked like a meeting room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is our meeting room,&rdquo; said Braiden, as he and Matt followed her inside. It was an old bedroom, repurposed for the repurpose of being a meeting room for this group of whatever Braiden is about to explain that they are. At the far end of the room was a window, but it was covered, giving the whole room a very ominous, shadowy quality. In the middle of the room was a table. Not many table manufacturers seem like the type to underwrite a book or movie so it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of table it was, but if there&rsquo;s a company out there that would be up for that then it was totally that kind of table. It was a rather large table, seating eight comfortably. The top was made of a hard wood, and was a deep shade of brown. It&rsquo;s not really important to the plot or anything, it was just a really, really nice table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt pulled out a chair for Kate, and she sat down. Sitting at the other end of the glorious table were the couple introduced to Kate earlier as Uncle Tom and Aunt Kathy. They were holding hands and looking at her with a happy excitement in their eyes, so Kate could tell that she wasn&rsquo;t in trouble or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did Pete make you some tea?&rdquo; asked Matt as he sat down next to her. Braiden took the seat on the other side of the table. Two adults could sit across from each other at the table without having their knees touch. It was a really, really nice table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; responded Kate, hesitantly. She was partially unsure how to feel about that old man, but also just really impressed by the quality of craftsmanship of the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do you think? It&rsquo;s a bit weird at first, but you&rsquo;ll --&rdquo; responded Braiden, but Kate interrupted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit weak, really. I&rsquo;m used to having fresh  - not from a tea bag. I don&rsquo;t want to sound ungrateful or anything, but he should really steep Darjeeling for longer than he did, especially since it&rsquo;s a bit older.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How do you know so much about tea?&rdquo; asked Matt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I grew up on a robot farm,&rdquo; Kate pointed out, as if saying, &ldquo;well, <em>duh</em>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The others looked at each other. It seemed there was more to Kate than they had expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;Pete was telling me something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, was he saying something about a phrophecy?&rdquo; responded Matt. &ldquo;Yeah, he does that all the time. Don&rsquo;t take him too seriously.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; added Braiden, &ldquo;he was selected for zombification years ago. For some reason it didn&rsquo;t take, but ever since then he&rsquo;s been a bit loopy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a relief. I mean, not that he&rsquo;s like that, but I was starting to wonder.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;About prophesies and destiny?&rdquo; asked Braiden. &ldquo;Those are just old cliches from books and movies. Scientists proved a few years ago that destiny doesn&rsquo;t actually exist. It&rsquo;s just mumbo-jumbo that writers use to give their plots a bit of weight. Good writers don&rsquo;t have to fall back on such hackneyed methods like that. Everybody knows the best way to make a story truly interesting is to add more explosions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, the chair Braiden was sitting on exploded. Splinters scattered everywhere, and he fell to the floor, just barely avoiding getting impaled on a jagged piece of wood. A handful of change fell out of Braiden&rsquo;s pockets and scattered across the hardwood floor. Everybody else in the room stood up in shock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s Aunt Kathy exclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Braiden, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s just this stupid chair. It was bound to happen one of these days.&rdquo; He stood up and brushed himself off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eating a bit too many of Amanda&rsquo;s brownies, I guess. Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, the chair wasn&rsquo;t made by the same people that made the table.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the last bit to Kate, who was staring at the shattered remains of Braiden&rsquo;s chair. Reassured, she and the others sat back down. Braiden gathered up the change that was scattered on the floor and took the chair next to the pile of what was once the chair he was sitting on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so the four of them - Braiden, Matt, and Matt&rsquo;s Uncle Tom and Aunt Kathy - began to explain to Kate just what this little group was all about. Kate was pretty sheltered from politics and worldly affairs her whole life, so they had to give her a brief history lesson, too. It&rsquo;s really unique and interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a long time - it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long - the area - it doesn&rsquo;t matter what area - was under the dominion of the Government. The aforesaid Government has split the aforesaid area over the course of the aforesaid time into Districts, and then they split those Districts into Districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If They had Their way,&rdquo; explained Braiden, &ldquo;they would split each and every one of us into our own District.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything wasn&rsquo;t just happy Districts within Districts, however. It turns out - and this is where things get really original - the Government was actually bad. They keep taxing everybody, and then they impose ridiculous Government Mandate Zones that ration things like sandwiches and Delicious Coke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did you want a Coke?&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s Uncle Tom interjected. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;ve got a guy who knows a guy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m okay, thanks,&rdquo; responded Kate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt&rsquo;s Family - most of them weren&rsquo;t actually related, incidentally - was part of an underground resistance movement called the Underground Resistance Movement. Their big thing - aside from not coming up with a good name for themselves - was that they wanted to overthrow the Government and bring things back to the Way they were when stuff was great, like the 2010&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That was the Golden Age for Humanity, Kate,&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s Aunt Kathy said. &ldquo;When Coke flowed like water in the 7 Elevens and the absolute best examples of Human creativity were being showcased in Tv, Movies, and especially on independently operated websites. Those were halcyon days.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They told Kate about the dangerous Peacecorps, which patrolled the Districts hunting down anyone they deemed a troublemaker. Kate had, of course, already experienced a Peacecorps patrol as she and Matt were making their way to the very house they were now sitting in. Braiden told Kate about the high-power peace enforcement techno blasters that the Peacecorps officers carried and about how dangerous they were. He emphasized this point to really drive home the idea that the Peacecorps officers were really scary. Kate was pretty scared, and she said things like &ldquo;I am scared of that&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rsquo;s really scary to me&rdquo; to clearly indicate her terror to anybody who might have been watching her, just in case her face wasn&rsquo;t expressive enough to carry the emotion on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The URM were the good guys, you see, and everybody in the Government were bad guys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You really couldn&rsquo;t write a story this good,&rdquo; Matt very astutely pointed out. &ldquo;Sure, it <em>would</em> make a really great book, but it would take some sort of genius to come up with a story like this. I mean, the bad guys have guns that can shoot lightning at us. If somebody did write a book about this, it would definitely have plenty of explosions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, the chair Braiden was sitting on exploded. This chair spontaneously disassembled itself just like the first one did, and with a loud clatter a handful of change once again fell out of Braiden&rsquo;s pockets. Everybody in the room stood up in alarm, but once again Braiden was fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The point is,&rdquo; continued Braiden as he gathered up his loose change, &ldquo;we have made it our mission to get rid of all of those rich aristocrats up in that Chamber Tower.&rdquo; He pointed in an arbitrary direction, as if pointing at the Government Headquarters. Kate looked where he pointed, but it was just at the blank wall. He was just making a point, not actually pointing where the tower really was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Braiden pulled out the last chair on his side of the table and sat down. &ldquo;We want to make it clear that you can join us if you want, Kate, but if you choose not to you can still stay here with us, where you&rsquo;ll safe from the dangers of the Mandate Zone. We don&rsquo;t expect you to put yourself in any danger if you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate thought about it for a moment, letting it all sink in. She looked around at all of the expectant faces looking at her, pleading at her. She thought about the ordeals she had gone through to get there. She thought about almost being captured by that Peacecorps patrol and Officer Traldo. She thought about the zombies roaming the streets. She thought about when she was attacked by bandits and how Matt rushed in to rescue her, and how even though it was really awesome it was also really scary. She was so overwhelmed by all of these new things, most of which were pretty terrifying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m just not cut out for being a freedom fighter. You might think we don&rsquo;t experience much Government Influence in District Delta, but we actually had things just as bad there. My . . .&rdquo; she paused for a moment, obviously hiding a really deep and interesting backstory, &ldquo;. . . family definitely met our share of Mandates. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t agree with your ieas, I just . . .&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The others looked at her sympathetically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Kate,&rdquo; said Matt&rsquo;s Uncle Tom, &ldquo;we understand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all looked at each other, clearly let down by her unwillingness to help them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; added Kate, &ldquo;I could probably help you come up with a better name, if you want.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt looked at Braiden with a worried look. &ldquo;But how will we . . .&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure something out, Matt.&rdquo; Braiden responded, &ldquo;if Kate doesn&rsquo;t want to put herself in danger just for some people she just met, we can&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt&rsquo;s Aunt Kathy added, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry about it, Kate.&rdquo; She was firmly supporting Kate&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;Nobody will blame you for not wanting to go on some silly dangerous mission like something out of one of those great movies from the good old days. Talking about prophecies and destiny or whatever is all well and good, but let&rsquo;s not forget that the real key to those stories is that they&rsquo;re full of unnecessary explosions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, everybody looked at Braiden, whose chair remained fully intact. He looked up at Kate and said, &ldquo;Matt&rsquo;s Aunt Kathy is right. I would probably make the same choice if I were in your shoes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I guess I can head back out tomorrow,&rdquo; said Matt, &ldquo;and try to find someone else who can help us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just such a shame,&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s Uncle Tom was also saying. &ldquo;She would have been so perfect.&rdquo; They were really laying it on thick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, now.&rdquo; replied Braiden. He leaned back in his chair which responded with a slow creak. Everyone in the room held their breath for a moment. &ldquo;She made her decision. Let&rsquo;s not make her feel terrible about it, even if it means that all of our plans might completely fall apart and the bad Government will go on forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of them nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all there is to it, then,&rdquo; concluded Braiden. &ldquo;You might as well go try to get some rest and we&rsquo;ll figure things out in the morning.&rdquo; He smiled and stood, and then everybody else stood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt and his Aunt and Uncle filed out of the meeting room, but Braiden stayed behind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Braiden,&rdquo; said Kate as she went to the door. &ldquo;Seriously, though, if you need some ideas for names . . .&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite alright, Kate,&rdquo; responded Braiden. &ldquo;You go along and make yourself at home. I have to look over some of these Mandate reports from the neighboring districts.&rdquo; Kate would have noticed the stack of papers earlier if it weren&rsquo;t for the sheer quality of the table upon which they sat. It really was a very nice table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate smiled sheepishly at Braiden and stepped out of the room, closing the door behind her. She was too absorbed in her own thoughts to notice the other girl Alice, who was standing in the kitchen glaring at her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Kate was walking away, she could hear from inside the meeting room the sound of a loud crash and a handful of change clattering across the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style='text-align: center'>* * * *</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that night, Kate was watching more Tv with Pete and the little girls. Matt and his Aunt and Uncle had left to take care of their own various things which aren&rsquo;t important to the plot. A woman entered the living area and addressed the girls. She was very motherly, and must have been either one of the girls&rsquo; mother or some sort of caretaker for the group&rsquo;s children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, Ashleys, it&rsquo;s time for bed,&rdquo; the woman said. The girls dejectedly flipped off the Tv and followed the woman down the hall and into another room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate looked over at Pete, who was sound asleep in his easy chair. She wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do, but felt curious about just how big this apartment was. She decided to do a bit of exploring, to figure out where Matt went.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She got up and looked down the hall leading away from the living area. It branched off to a stairway in one direction, and a few doors in the other. Kate headed up the stairs, which led to another living area and some more doors. There was no Tv in this area, and Kate noticed that a big set of curtains covered the wall behind where the Tv was downstairs. Opening the curtain, Kate was able to see the view of the vast cityscape that was visible from this old penthouse. She stared in wonder, never having seen anything like it. Buildings seemed to stretch off forever, an amazing mosaic of sizes, shapes, and colors twinkling in the night sky all the way to the horizon. A Peacecorps patrol plane (or car) slowly drifted along an avenue below, shining its spotlight at the ground beneath it. Further in the distance Kate could see some great, long vehicle - a transit train - zipping along a rail between buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She watched this spectacle for what seemed to her like hours. Eventually she heard a voice behind one of the doors down the hall - Matt&rsquo;s voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She closed the curtain and walked quietly down the hall, careful to overhear what he was saying. He was talking to someone. Kate could hear a muffled voice - a woman&rsquo;s voice, but not quite human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching the door, she carefully turned the knob and opened the door just a tiny bit to see inside. What she saw almost made her scream because of how shocking it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you ready for it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the dark bedroom, Matt was sitting on a dirty mattress that had no sheets or blankets. In his hand was an opened can, and he was scooping something out of it with a spoon. Just in front of him, standing ominously in the light cast by the single overhead light bulb was a female zombie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These should be a bit more fresh,&rdquo; Matt was saying. &ldquo;I just got these cans today. How is it?&rdquo; He lifted the spoon to the zombie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beast before him was slowly swaying, staring half at Matt and half at nothing. Its clothes were a tattered mess, but Matt had obviously made some effort recently to look after them. The creature had clearly been a woman before whatever grim fate transformed it into what it was. It had long, once beautiful hair, and its slender frame must have been quite striking. Now its darkened and scarred flesh hung from its bones in a most displeasing way. It responded to him in a mixture of mumbling and grunting, and Kate couldn&rsquo;t understand what it - or perhaps she - said. It wasn&rsquo;t taking the spoonful of mush that Matt was offering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come on, you have to eat your brains.&rdquo; Matt said. Finally he was able to get the zombie to take another spoonful into its mouth. It moaned in response, either approving or disapproving, Kate couldn&rsquo;t tell which.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The zombie replied with another garbled sentence, but Kate could have sworn she heard the phrase, &ldquo;looking for a job&rdquo; Then it began reaching for Matt&rsquo;s shirt. Kate was worried for a moment, and thought about trying to rush to stop this monster from attacking her new friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt sighed and calmly held the zombie&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;My shirt is fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to get a job whether I tuck my shirt in or not.&rdquo; He offered it another spoonful of brain mush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate was very confused by what she was hearing. The zombie responded again, and this time Kate was sure it was asking Matt if he needed any money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Matt responded, choking back a tear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate carefully closed the door again, and stood stunned in the darkness. It had dawned upon her that this wasn&rsquo;t just a zombie. The way Matt was speaking to it, and the way it was attempting to speak back was suddenly quite clear. Matt was sitting in that sparse, cold room, calmly spoon feeding his zombified mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She realized then that this wasn&rsquo;t just a fight of principal for him, this struggle against the Government. For him, this was personal. He was looking for revenge, and at that moment, Kate felt an incredible appreciation for him and his cause. She had lost both of her parents, too. It was clear to her, then, that she had to offer her help to this justified - albeit poorly named - group of freedom fighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She went right down, then, to find Braiden in the meeting room and tell him that she had changed her mind. She had decided that she was going to fight to see those Government aristocrats put to justice. Also, she wanted to get another look at that table. It was a really, really nice table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that, Kate,&rdquo; Braiden responded. &ldquo;You may very well help us save the whole world, from right here in District Alpha: Government Mandate Zone!&rdquo;</p>\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n<p>About five years ago I posted <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/289/'>pictures</a> here of some alleyways and dumpsters in West Lafayette, Indiana. For some reason I am fascinated by the secrets hiding behind the scenes in urban areas. Well-kept storefronts and urban planning can spruce up a city street, but it&#039;s an artificial beauty. Garbage piles, abandoned vehicles, and dumpsters - there is no superficiality in these things. On the other hand, there&#039;s a whole underground of people who fill these spaces graffiti, just because they can. What we get is a fascinating world filled with garbage and decay that we are programmed to ignore. A city is all slight of hand, distracting us with trees and polished windows to keep us from noticing the unavoidable filth that humanity leaves behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last year, I&#039;ve lived in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago. Chicago is a much larger city than West Lafayette, and so it has a great deal more filth to hide away. I&#039;ve been meaning to capture some of it with my camera, and recently I finally did.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/wicker_park_alleys/IMG_9929.jpg' height='1200' width='800'><div class='caption'>Wicker Park is the area around Milwaukee Avenue, from about Chicago Avenue in the South to about Armitage in the North.

The main page is structured like a timeline, so you can get a quick view of the content that has been posted recently, and so you can see posts dating back to the before-times. Also, the site takes advantage of modern browsers so you can always hit 'back' and 'forward' to navigate just as you would any other site. Posts on DenyConformity.com are categorized by a number of tags, which you can use to see similarly tagged content. Use the tags page (with the link at the top of the site) to see every tag on the site, or click on an individual tag at the bottom of any post to see all the posts with that tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DenyConformity.com is <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/367/All_new_for_2012'>currently</a> in Beta, which means that stuff might not work right. If something doesn&#039;t work like you think it should, report it to <a href='mailto:beta@denyconformity.com' target='_blank'>beta@denyconformity.com</a> with a description of what you were trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dude called Shauvon McGill started this website 2005 as a place to write about non-conformity. It quickly became a stupid place where he posted the uninteresting rants of an angst-y college student. More recently he has written much more interesting stuff. It&#039;s not dumb, now, I promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shauvon is interested in Comedy, Photography, Fiction, Technology, and Ideas. Most of the stuff he posts here will fit into one of those categories. Check back daily (mostly) for content ranging from discussions of computer games to satire to beautiful (mostly) photographs - which are all available for sale, by the way - to original hand-drawn web comics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only goal of DenyConformity.com is to be an interesting website place. If you&#039;ve been able to kill a few minutes of your day looking at cool pictures or reading a dumb thing and you don&#039;t think it was a complete waste of your time, DenyConformity.com has succeeded. If there&#039;s ever anything you&#039;d like to read about or anything, feel free to make a request by sending an email to <a href='mailto:requests@denyconformity.com' target='_blank'>requests@denyconformity.com</a> or by making a comment down below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your continued support is greatly appreciated. Shauvon doesn&#039;t get much out of this other than the satisfaction of being able to entertain people. If you have enjoyed something you saw here, you might consider buying a print of a picture or purchasing an ad on the site. Above all, though, the best thing you can do is share the site with your friends (we&#039;ll even take enemies). It&#039;s really appreciated.</p>",

      "title": "The Color Run pt. 1",
      "text": "<p>There&#039;s this thing called the Color Run. It happens in a bunch of cities all over the country, and just this past weekend it happened in Chicago. It also happens that it&#039;s one of the coolest things ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s just a regular old 5k, except that at predetermined locations along the route, a team of people toss colored powder at you. Everybody (there are thousands of runners) starts perfectly clean, and ends up completely covered in bright colors. It&#039;s truly amazing, and you should go check right now to see if it&#039;s coming to a city near you. Seriously, go to the <a href='http://thecolorrun.com/' target='_blank'>website</a> right now. I&#039;ll wait. It will be an experience you will never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Alyson ran the thing and I brought my camera. I wrapped it up in a garbage bag ahead of time to try to protect it from being color blasted, in case you worry about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0134.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I made sure I knew where the Yellow station was (it&#039;s my favorite color), and it just happened to be nearby the starting line (the route was sort of clothespin-shaped). The buckets full of powder looked pretty exciting.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0136.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The website said that they were going to let off groups of 1000 runners every five minutes for an hour. That&#039;s a lot of runners.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0143.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The website also said to wear as much white as possible. These lightning-bolt people were pretty neat (though you&#039;ll soon see that it surely didn&#039;t make much difference), but a lot of people thought it would be neat to wear colorful socks or other secondary clothes. That really defeats the purpose.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0149.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>These Blues Brothers (emphasis on the &#039;blue&#039;) were there to warm up the crowd waiting to kick off at the starting line. The atmosphere at the starting line was really great - like a dance party.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0150.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here&#039;s a group setting off. You can see some of the colorful socks there, which I don&#039;t think was a good idea. You can also see a few sunglasses, which is probably a really great idea.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0176.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It was a few minutes before any runners showed up at the yellow station. The first few people came through really quickly, like they were just there to run or something. Why you would come to this thing just to run, I have no idea.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0192.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The people posted at the yellow station had little things like mustard bottles which they used to squirt nice little streams of yellow powder. You can see one just to the left, in this shot.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0205.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I think they were told not to aim at the face, but obviously they bent that rule a bit.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0207.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>There was, of course, collateral damage on the color team.

      "title": "How to Keep Your Apartment Organized",
      "text": "<p>Somehow my email address was signed up for this &ldquo;Apartment Guide&rdquo; newsletter, which basically just sends me random garbage about apartments pretty much every day. I totally don&rsquo;t need that, since I&rsquo;m already an apartment expert. Apparently it&rsquo;s totally cool to post articles about how to Apartment better, so it&rsquo;s time for me to chime in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of particular interest is this <a href='http://www.movingtoday.com/take-steps-to-stay-organized-in-your-apartment/?WT.mc_id=32706' target='_blank'>article</a> &ldquo;Take Steps to Stay Organized in Your Apartment&rdquo; which came to me today. I haven&rsquo;t read that article, but I am sure I can come up with a better guide to keeping your apartment organized. For your consideration, I give you my version of that guide (with some marginally relevant pictures I dug up from my archives).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>How to Keep Your Apartment Organized<br />\r\nor, <em>Don&rsquo;t Put That There</em></h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_8417.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>An example of an unorganized apartment. In my defense, most of it was caused by the cat. That little dude never picks up after himself.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s your apartment. Ultimately, you can do whatever you want. Let&rsquo;s just face the facts, though - hot babes do not want to come hang out in a slob&rsquo;s trash-pile. Cool Dudes are not going to want to chill in an unorganized apartment. If you ever want to run for President - and who doesn&rsquo;t, come on - they will know that you had an unorganized apartment, and when the media gets a hold of that you&rsquo;re done for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a basic instinct in all of us to avoid unorganized situations. Why do you think we started building houses in the first place? We did it to get the Hell out of Nature. Nature is pretty unorganized. In fact, Nature should really read this guide. You should probably print a few copies of this guide out and staple them to some trees outside. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_0137.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>How disorganized.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, the point is that nobody wants to be with you if you aren&rsquo;t organized. I&rsquo;m not your Mom or anything, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you how to live your life. I&rsquo;m just telling you that people are going to constantly judge you. Here are some tips for you, if you feel like getting off your butt and not putting your garbage just any old place. Unlike some other guides out there, though, this guide will actually help you &ldquo;turn over a new leaf&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Nature) and maintain a more organized apartment - not just for this year, but maybe even into the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t put that there.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, that thing doesn&rsquo;t go there. Just put it away now, while it&rsquo;s in your hand. If you put it there, you&rsquo;ll just have to make more of an effort later because you&rsquo;ll have to pick it back up and then put it away. Just put it away now, and you&rsquo;ll be done with it. I mean, unless wherever that thing goes is kind of hard to get to and your favorite show is on TV. You can put it away later.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_5771.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Some things - lids to hamster cages, for instance - should definitely be put where they belong.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leave your door open at night.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This might seem counter-intuitive. Sure, initially you&rsquo;ll have some cleanup to take care of, but you&rsquo;ll be really surprised how being robbed can make it much easier to organize your place. Okay, so you can try to sell some stuff on Craigslist or something, but that just takes so long and you have to talk to people. Just get yourself robbed and you&rsquo;ll cut down how much stuff you have really quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_8076.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>These are actual burglar&#039;s fingerprints.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find that you have some areas that just seem to &ldquo;attract&rdquo; clutter, just throw a couple lit matches in the pile and watch as your problems take care of themselves. You might stand by with a bucket of water or something just in case the fire spreads to something you don&rsquo;t want to get rid of, like the walls or the floor. Nothing says &ldquo;unorganized&rdquo; like not having a floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_0785.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Guns don&rsquo;t really work quite as well (nor do tires).</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designate a &ldquo;garbage room.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why I like to get an apartment with one more bedroom than I need. Now when you see some clutter or disorder, just scoop it up in your arms and toss it into your spare room. It can help to have a friend quickly open and close the door for you, so you don&rsquo;t get buried in your own organization technique. You don&rsquo;t want to end up like a cartoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_8097.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Stay in there. I have company coming over.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lie to yourself / others.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to deal with an unorganized apartment is to just redefine the term &ldquo;unorganized.&rdquo; Try out the following handy mantras on yourself next time you find yourself questioning your organization:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style='font-style: italic'>\r\n<li>Look, the reason you put things where you put them is because it&rsquo;s easier. Convenience is the whole point of organization, isn&rsquo;t it?</li>\r\n<li>What do you mean? That&rsquo;s where that thing goes.</li>\r\n<li>Hey, look, Mythbusters is on.</li>\r\n<li>Sure, that thing is in the way. We could put it away, or we could play some video games.</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re out of matches.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This technique works almost as well on others, too. When your friends come over, or you have some special lady company, just tell them something like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&ldquo;I know, I kind of hate it, too. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been reading these books about ancient Chinese mysticism, and apparently this is best for the energy of the space.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;What do you mean? That&rsquo;s where that thing goes.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Oh, like your place is any better.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;I actually just moved in, so I&rsquo;m still unpacking.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a feud with the garbage man right now, so he&rsquo;s refusing to take any of it. I can either leave it in here or down on the street where identity thieves and raccoons are going to get into it.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting ready for a yard sale. You want that? Dollar fifty.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_6195.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Those are my roommate&rsquo;s, I swear.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stop seeking motivation from the Internet.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, this place - the Internet - is only for distracting you from your problems. Why are you sitting there reading that instead of just putting stuff away. You aren&rsquo;t going to magically get an email that cleans your room. That&rsquo;s why your parents made you do it when you were a kid - so you&rsquo;d get into the habit. You know what? No more Internet until you finish your chores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously. We&rsquo;re done. Clean your room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/apt_organized/IMG_6742.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Then shovel the sidewalk.</div>",

Aside from the obvious concerns of dust getting in and on the camera, the thick air made it difficult to properly focus, and substantially reduced the sunlight. Luckily it was a beautiful day, so there was still plenty of light and a cool breeze blew the dust away pretty quickly.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0267.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This picture, for example, is unfortunately focused on the arms spraying powder instead of the arms groping blindly through the yellow cloud.

It was a fun tongue in cheek hostility.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0286.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It&#039;s kind of gross, but you could easily tell which people were more sweaty than others, and where.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0292.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The green station was right before the yellow one. They must have been absolutely crazy, because almost everybody we saw was quite green.

It was pretty epic.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0359.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It was like watching an action movie to see all of these runners emerge from a billowing explosion of color.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0369.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Sometimes you can&#039;t help but smile at some people. Then you get a mouthful of cornstarch. It&#039;s basically a win-win.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0376.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here are a couple more pictures of this serious chick.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0381.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>You can see just how completely the world was shrouded in dust.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/colorrun/IMG_0383.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Those bottles had some pretty good range. Eventually, though, the pathway was completely covered in a solid inch of dust - about half-way through the whole event.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately I can only take so many pictures before I run out of space, and I was nervous about taking my camera out of the garbage bag cover I had fashioned, so I just had to call it quits. We met up with Alyson, who was pretty well covered with color, and found our way to the finish line ceremony. Each runner was given a pouch of color. You can probably spot them in some of my pictures. They were all sorts of colors, not just the basic blue, red, green, and yellow of the course. At the finishing line, a huge group of people gathered - probably four hundred by the time we made our way there. Suddenly the call went out, and everybody tore open their pouches and flung the contents in the air. It was an incredible 45 seconds. Afterwords everybody was a tableau of random colors.

I didn&#039;t think much about them when I&#039;ve seen them before, but it recently occurred to me that I could be making them and selling them for fat stacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent the better part of today running around downtown Chicago trying to build a library of letter pictures. The idea is that you take pictures of architecture and inanimate objects that look like different letters of the alphabet. Then you can spell out your last name or your favorite word or something and hang it in your game room or office. How hard can it be?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/picture_letters/i.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>What letter looks like a penis?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s actually more challenging than you might think. I figured that some letters would be easier to find in the wild than others. Plenty of windows look like an 'E.' Street lamps and plenty of other things look like 'I&#039;s.' The thing is, though, that in practice it&#039;s kind of hard to get decent versions of those shapes. The real toughies were 'G' 'B' 'J' and 'C.' It turns out that those shapes aren&#039;t very common without looking more like other letters instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/picture_letters/g.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I was worried I wouldn&#039;t find a 'G' until I came across this little squiggle.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, it was a really fun little project, and I especially enjoyed taking strange closeup pictures of random things and then pulling out my little notebook to make note of which letters I&#039;d captured. Finding a perfect example of a letter is pretty exciting, and finally coming across a letter  I had trouble finding is genuinely satisfying. The best way to go is to just keep your eyes peeled for any familiar shapes. Don&#039;t just search for one letter at a time. It&#039;s definitely much more exciting and faster to just get whatever letters you find.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/picture_letters/q.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Q was a fun one to find.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You should give it a shot some time. If you know somebody for whom this sort of thing would make a good gift, spend an afternoon trying to get some pictures together. It will save you the cost of a dumb Skymall item, and it will challenge your creative side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, if you&#039;re lazy or don&#039;t have the photographic skills to do it or you don&#039;t live in Chicago, you could buy one from me! Send an email to <a href='mailto:photo@denyconformity.com'>photo@denyconformity.com</a> if you&#039;re interested. I&#039;m serious.

I decided to respond in kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While at some consignment / used clothing / junk store, I found an old back-issue of PC Magazine - from the late 90&rsquo;s. It was full of articles and ads talking about really old computer stuff that&rsquo;s so obsolete now it&rsquo;s actually a joke. At least, I hoped it would make for a pretty good joke. I knew it would be the perfect random thing to send to my friends at Univox, so I mailed it to John, along with a letter. In the interest of continuing my series on &ldquo;I have nothing to write about so I&rsquo;m just digging up random stuff out of my drawers&rdquo; I have transcribed the letter below.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 90%; margin: auto; text-indent: 3em'>\r\n\r\n<p>Danielle Moinet<br />\r\nUnivox Corporation<br />\r\n1446 W.

      "text": "<p>Once, when I was a kid, my Dad took me to a gun range. We went with another guy and his kid - their family was sort of friends with my family or whatever. We had an old .22, the other dad had a huge-ass muzzle-loader, and there was some sort of medium-caliber revolver. I don&rsquo;t remember much about the afternoon, other than that the muzzle-loader was pretty terrifying. I fired the .22 a few times, and I gave the revolver a try, but generally I was a pretty scared kid who didn&rsquo;t like doing things that could easily murder somebody. I haven&rsquo;t changed a whole lot, but I kind of want to go back to a shooting range to fire a gun again. Mainly because I don&rsquo;t remember what they sound like in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, I totally just heard a few gunshots outside. Admittedly I am not sure what gunshots sound like, but movies have taught me that they can be pretty varied. All I know is that, just now, outside, there was this <em>pop pop pop</em> sound, like three tiny explosions. It happened all in a row, like one, two, three. I mean, that&rsquo;s totally gunshots, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that it was kind of nice out today, not like the sweltering heat that we&rsquo;ve been having. I&rsquo;ve been worried about the power bill from all this AC action, so I had my window open. That&rsquo;s how I was able to hear this sound so clearly. I bet somebody had a score to settle, and he wanted to take advantage of this nice weather to come on over and settle said score. That is just the sort of calculating individual who would make sure there are no witnesses. I&rsquo;m not completely sure, but I might just count as a witness that needs to be silenced. Don&rsquo;t tell anybody I told you about this, seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know the Fourth of July just happened. Perhaps they were fireworks, you might posit. Look, you - the Fourth of July was like a week ago. I don&rsquo;t know much about people who launch fireworks in urban areas, but they totally seem like the sort that would get bored easily, so they&rsquo;re certainly on to other crazy illegal things that the police won&rsquo;t do anything about. Not only that, but I know what fireworks sound like. This was not like any firework. There was no fizzle. There was no sizzle. I heard no sparks, nor did I hear any report of a launcher or something like that. Also, there&rsquo;s the fact that there were three of them, in quick succession. Like, it was just &ldquo;blam, blam, blam&rdquo; and then nothing. Who would light three fireworks at once and then do nothing else? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that three bullets would totally be enough to settle a score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really paying much attention before the sound, because I was busy looking at the Internet and I don&rsquo;t usually pay much attention to the out-of-doors. However, now that I think about it I think there was actually a scream or shouting or something before the sound. I think I heard a guy shouting, possibly saying something like &ldquo;take it easy bro, let&rsquo;s work this out!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t actually hear anybody say that, and I&rsquo;m not totally sure what somebody would really say when a guy is all up on them looking to settle a score, but movies teach me it would be something like that. It was one of those things that I normally wouldn&rsquo;t have thought much about, but then I heard some sounds that were totally gunshots so now I think it must have been a guy yelling. I mean, at the time it sounded like maybe just a car revving, but it could also have been a guy yelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not totally sure what&rsquo;s going on now, because I can&rsquo;t hear much when I&rsquo;m crammed in between these coats. Needless to say, when I work up the courage to come out of my closet here and try to check the police blotter for info about a score settling gun crime in my area, I&rsquo;ll definitely post the whys and wherefores of the whole thing. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s actually pretty comfortable in here. I have some shoes piled up like a little butt pillow, and these coats aren&rsquo;t bad to lean against. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just spend the night in here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh crap, I should probably have closed that window . . .</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>So a lot of talk has been going around about supposed <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/439/Opinion_Those_Were_Totally_Gunshots_Just_Now'>sounds</a> out back and theories about what those sounds were. Sure, we could knock around ideas all day about what we think about this or that sound, but where would that get us? The fact is that there are sounds all the time, and it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to try to categorize and place each and every one of them. I mean, so what if something outside kind of sounds like it might be, oh, I don&rsquo;t know, gunshots or something, you know? That&rsquo;s just distracting us from the real issue - namely, do you want to order a pizza or something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know a pretty good place, or we could Yelp it if you want to try something new. I&rsquo;m totally up for whatever. I&rsquo;m actually pretty hungry - I didn&rsquo;t have much of a dinner last night and I skipped breakfast. You know how it is, sometimes you get really busy and you just don&rsquo;t realize where the time went. It&rsquo;s not really important what I had for dinner last night. Come on, It&rsquo;s not like I only had some old nip chees that were in a jacket pocket in the closet. That would just be weird, man. It was some captain&rsquo;s wafers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s neither here nor there, though. Oh, hey, maybe we could play some Xbox. Do you want to order a pizza and play some Xbox? I&rsquo;ve been playing this one game lately. You play as an undercover cop working in a really dangerous neighborhood. I get pretty into it, but it&rsquo;s really intense. In the game there are these two gangs that are at war, and sometimes dudes will just start shooting at each other out of nowhere and . . . you know what, let&rsquo;s not play that game. Man, I haven&rsquo;t fired up Viva Pinata in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to move the couch really quick, actually. Oh, I was doing some redecorating. I just wanted to see how the room looked if I moved stuff around a bit. I&rsquo;ve been reading up on feng shui lately. You know, feng shui, where sometimes if you pile up a bunch of furniture in front of the back door and windows it charges the room with positive energy. You don&rsquo;t feel that energy? Well, we can put it back for now, anyway. I guess the couch is better in front of the TV. I guess they didn&rsquo;t have TV&rsquo;s back when they invented feng shui, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s just order a pizza then, yeah? We can do it online. It&rsquo;s really easy. Just ignore my other browser tabs. I like to check in on the local news sometimes. It&rsquo;s pretty funny what you read on the old Police blotter&rsquo;s website occasionally. I check it all the time. My street is actually one of the lowest crime areas in the city. Did you know that? I totally did - it&rsquo;s why I moved here. Yup, I&rsquo;m glad I checked the old crime reports a long time ago, before this morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, the other thing was that my phone died. Just in case you tried to call me - that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t answer. It&rsquo;s better now, I plugged it in. You know how these smartphones go these days, they just have no battery life. You can never tell if somebody hasn&rsquo;t charged their phone or if they just left it in the other room and for whatever reason they&rsquo;re too scared to go get it. I mean, too scared or lazy. Either one - there&rsquo;s no reason I said &ldquo;scared&rdquo; first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about those fireworks stores, though, huh? Did you know they just keep selling cheap fireworks for like ever? The Fourth was like a week ago! They have those &ldquo;buy one get fifteen free&rdquo; deals, now. You can get a bunch of those popper things that just go &ldquo;pop, pop, pop&rdquo; really quick, like one, two, three. I mean, I&rsquo;m guessing they have a thing like that. It would be pretty exciting. The police sure don&rsquo;t seem to care much about if you launch fireworks in the city, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, yeah, we should get on that pizza train. We could try this one place. I actually have a coupon. I mean, we could Yelp it, or we could use this coupon. Whatever you want to do - I&rsquo;ve had it a while. I was organizing my closet earlier and I found it. Crazy, huh? Just doing some spring - er, summer cleaning. Oh yeah, I always like to organize my winter coats and sweaters in the middle of summer. Anyway, yeah, I found this coupon and some captain&rsquo;s wafers and a couple bucks in change. We are set for the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I already ate the captain&rsquo;s wafers...</p>\r\n",

What you may not know is that a few years ago, not long before the site&rsquo;s big April Fool&rsquo;s Day relaunch, my company was bought out. A large, mysterious corporation moved in and put forward a pretty hefty investment to own this mighty empire. It turns out that I might have made this bed for myself, in fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 2006, I wrote an ill-conceived <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/149/My_ECN_job'>post</a> about a job I had. It was mainly about some interesting names I had found in a Purdue database. The last name I found belonged to one Harland Fankboner, an Purdue graduate from way back in 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/ECN/pictures10.gif' /> <div class='caption'>He still looks like a Fankboner.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Well it just so happens that this enigmatic corporation which wholly owns yours truly goes by the name of Fankboner Industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/fankboner_logo.jpg' /> <div class='caption'>This is their logo, which I only know from the letterhead on their - frankly quite pushy - letters.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it a coincidence? Of course not. As I was told (or at least what I&rsquo;m allowed to tell you) is that my benefactors wanted to maintain a silent role in ensuring DenyConformity.com maintained a &ldquo;more intentional drive for integrity&rdquo; and that it became a &ldquo;more interesting place.&rdquo; Until now I had to follow their directives (such as not talking about their namesake anymore) without acknowledging their presence (or even their existence). I had to keep that up until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new DenyConformity.com was a bit of a &ldquo;last straw&rdquo; scenario for my benefactors. Either I succeeded in finally making this little arm of Fankboner Industries finally successful, or they were going to step in and take over. Unfortunately for me, though I tried my best at the former, the latter has come to pass. Please welcome Fankboner Industries as they step in to really kick this website into shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you expect from the new Fankboner Industries Presents DenyConformity.com?

      "text": "<p><strong>Or, How Two Dudes Did a Thing Despite Being a Pair of Bumbling Idiots</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy riding a bike. They provide cheap transportation (over short distances), they&rsquo;re fun to work on and maintain, and they&rsquo;re pretty good excercise. The problem - especially for me - is that they take up a lot of space. I have a 2009 Specialized Secteur, and it&rsquo;s huge. I have to buy the largest frame Specialized makes. Where can I keep this thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had two bikes stolen from me, so I&rsquo;m not interested in leaving my bike outside for any length of time. That means I have to keep it inside my apartment, where space is at a premium. I&rsquo;ve heard about these kits you can buy which amount to a series of pulleys you attach to your ceiling. You can then hoist your bike into the air like you just don&rsquo;t care (though if you have any sense of gravity at all you might be a bit concerned). My new apartment happens to have pretty high ceilings, so I figured the time was perfect to give one of these kits a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend Andrew Monkey stopped by to give me a hand installing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is the kit that arrived from Amazon.com. As shown on the box you can also use this thing to hoist ladders. I bet you could probably hoist all kinds of things (as long as they don&rsquo;t exceed the 50 pound weight limit). I was going to make a silly list of things you could hoist - things like pants, children, other hoists, and that kind of thing - but I want to keep this post serious. This is important.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack2.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is my bike. I did those handlebars up in yellow and painted the seat post myself. There is more yellow I wish to apply, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. For scale, that lightswitch is a standard light switch height, so you can picture my bike seat being as tall as that.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack3.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is the corner I wanted to put the thing. This way my bike will be up and out of the way and hanging right over the litter box - just so the cat is reminded who&rsquo;s boss around here.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack8.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The kit came with the two ceiling mounts, two pulleys with little armatures (not pictured), a really long rope (not pictured), and a bunch of screws. The instructions show the thing being mounted directly to a ceiling joist. I&rsquo;m not sure if my ceiling is made of drywall or plaster or what, but I do know that you shouldn&rsquo;t just screw this thing any old place. It definitely has to go right into a joist. The directions say that you can mount the thing to a board and then attach that board to the joists, and that sounded like a good idea to me. I figured it would be easier to attach a board to the ceiling than these cumbersome things. If you have a garage with exposed joists, you can just screw the pieces up there and call it a day, you lucky dog you.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack4.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The only board I could get was eight feet long, so Andrew helped me measure it in half.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack5.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The dude knows a good <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/378/The_Parker_Jotter'>pen</a> when he sees one.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack6.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>A four foot board would be the perfect length for my bike. We have enough board left over to make another one of these (if I got another kit, anyway).</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack7.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is unrelated. If you see my sister, don&rsquo;t tell her that this is her birthday present, but that she should come see me for some reason. Make something up.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack9.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The board was very much not straight. I figured it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, since it was the only board we had, and - you know - whatever.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack10.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Andrew brought his circular saw to cut the board with. I recommend having a friend who has lots of tools that you don&rsquo;t have. You have to put up with them babbling at you about who knows what, but it&rsquo;s worth it when you need a circular saw.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack11.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I very precisely marked out where the two hoist pulleys needed to go. They hang onto the bike (or the bike hangs onto them) at the handlebars and the seat, so I marked those locations on the board.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack12.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Woah, this is a picture of me. Not many of those around.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack13.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I screwed the pulley assemblies onto the board where I marked for them to be screwed. It seemed like the thing to do.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack14.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Now it was time to figure out where the board needed to go. There are two ways to find studs (or joists) in the wall (or ceiling). You can take a drill and make hundreds of little holes until you drill into solid wood, or you can get a stud finder, which uses magic to tell you where the studs are. I had to run to the Sheller Mart down the street to pick up a 9-Volt battery (the magic kind), and I set about finding where the joist was. Stud finders might seem like a hokey thing, but they work great. Explain that one, science!</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack15.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>While I was doing that, Andrew fired up some Obama Type.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack16.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here are some of the bits I didn&rsquo;t include in the other picture (except the drill, that was in the other picture). The tape measure and drill were not included in the kit but they&rsquo;re good things to have around. Don&rsquo;t rely on your babbling friend to have those things for you - you should have them for yourself.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack17.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here I am gloriously modeling the screws I got to attach the board to the ceiling. They were like four inches long and pretty serious. I wanted to be sure they would get through the two-inch thick board and still have plenty of screw left for the joist.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack18.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>We chose a drill bit to make some pilot holes. We thought were were being really smart by holding it up next to the screws, and we took this picture to document just how smart we were.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack19.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Then this happened. The drill bit just hauled off and broke inside the board. Now there is a drill bit permanently included with my ceiling hoist, so there&rsquo;s that.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack20.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>So we picked out a new drill bit, and re-drilled the pilot holes. What a couple of bumbling idiots.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack21.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I put all of the screws in position, ready to just go right up into the ceiling. I was really optimistic about that happening.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack22.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This picture really belies the fact that it was a pain in the ass (and the arm) to hold the board in place. I was standing basically on top of an ancient ladder (thanks for letting me use that, Andrew) and holding that up about as high as I could. The ceiling is very high. I had to line the thing up, and then commence to screwing. That&rsquo;s no easy feat for an idiot as prone to bumbling as I.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack23.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>As you can probably imagine - as I can imagine now that I have the magnificent power of hindsight - the screws didn&rsquo;t go into the ceiling joist basically at all. I live in an extremely old building, from back in the day when they built buildings before they started not making things like they used to. We decided that the ceiling joist also needed some pilot holes, which meant marking where they needed to go. This picture shows me putting the screws in a bit further - or farther, whatever.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack25.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>With all of the screws poking out like this, all I had to do was hold the board in place and give it a good whack - or thwack, whatever - and I would have a mark for each screw. Again, we decided this plan made us some sort of pair of geniouses. Not being able to spell geniuses belies the fact that I am, in fact, part of a pair of them.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack24.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I got back on up there and gave the board the aforesaid whack / thwack.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack26.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Then I hauled off and drilled that sucker with the drill bit that survived drilling the other holes. This was a difficult thing, because man that ceiling joist was one tough mother. I could go an inch or two, but then it felt like I just couldn&rsquo;t drill any further / farther. It was like trying to drill into rock, or like, some sort of heavy metal. Try as I might, I just could not get the screws to go in all the way. The really tough thing was that Andrew was too short to give it a try himself. I was the only person who could make this thing happen. </div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack27.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>For some reason, Alyson wasn&rsquo;t completely confident.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack28.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>New plan! We attached a pair of spacers to the bottom of the board. These incredibly high tech components would mean that the ridiculously over-sized screws I bought wouldn&rsquo;t have to go into the joist quite as far, thereby hopefully meaning that I would actually be able to screw them in all the way.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack29.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The holes in the spacers are very scientific calibration and load-bearing components, not side-effects of the fact that the spacers were once part of a piece of Ikea furniture.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack30.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I don&rsquo;t know why I thought you would want to see a picture of some holes in a ceiling, but here you go. Feast your eyes.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack31.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The spacers did the trick! Using my incredible man-strength, I was able to get all of the monster screws into the ceiling as far as they could go. The people upstairs haven&rsquo;t complained about screws sticking out of their floor yet.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack32.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>All I had to do now was run the rope through the various pulleys, starting with this little hole where the rope starts.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack33.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Andrew had a grand old time, and we had only strung one of the pulleys up.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack34.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here it is fully assembled. Without a weight like a bike or a child on the little fingers, they don&rsquo;t both go up and down as you pull the rope. This makes it actually not as fun to play with as when there was only one pulley on it, but this isn&rsquo;t some sort of toy.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack35.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I hooked my bike up to it and gave the rope a tug. It worked! Both armatures rose at the same time, and it was not terribly difficult to pull the rope with my bike attached. It only took a small fraction of my fantastic man-strength. Here you see the look of terror on Alyson&rsquo;s face as I use the hoist for the first time.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack38.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Andrew is a normally sized man, and it was well over his head. I can still bump my head on it - in fact I have - but that&rsquo;s just because of my freakish height.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack37.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Just because the project was finished doesn&rsquo;t mean that I was done being an idiot. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t assume that the rope is plenty long enough and cut the excess <em>while the bike is hanging there</em>. Don&rsquo;t you realize (I&rsquo;m talking to myself here) that the excess slack is so you can <em>lower the bike</em>? Luckily (I&rsquo;m talking to you, again), after doing the stupid thing, the excess rope was actually long enough to work, so after re-doing the whole pulley system, I can actually use the thing.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/bike_rack/bikerack36.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Even though it was installed by a couple of goomers, the ceiling bike hoist system works pretty great. There was a bit of panic right before I used it for the first time that it was too close to the wall (you can see that the front wheel is turned slightly so it fits better). It just barely has enough room, but this is definitely something you should remember to watch out for if you ever try to do this in a less stupid way than I did.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have some bikes (or other things weighing less than 50 pounds) in your way, but plenty of ceiling space in which to hang them? You should definitely consider buying and assembling one of these contraptions. The ceiling bike hoist is a cool thing that is a bit easier to use than it was to install, but it will definitely pay for itself in the convenience it brings. My bike has been hanging up there for about a week, and it&rsquo;s still holding strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you bring a friend along to help you with your ceiling bike hoist. Just try not to bumble quite as much as we did when you go to install it.</p>\r\n",

It&#039;s all made up, but entirely based on things that happen in the game. We open on a aspiring young captain, setting off on a vital mission to save the Federation. . .]</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class='firstletter'>Captain&rsquo;s log, stardate . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does anybody know what day it is? Oh, screw it, I&rsquo;ll start over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I stop this thing? No, I just want to erase it and start over. This one? Nope, that just made it louder. This is weird. I can hear myself. Here. Okay, that got it, right? Damn it. Ok, whatever. That&rsquo;s fine. Everything is okay. I will just start over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, um, hello, there. Greetings. This is Captain Brandon Kirk (no relation), of the spaceship Brandon Kirk. Now I have proof that everything in my life is not just a series of completely random encounters, because I have achieved the rank of Captain and gotten my own ship which I have named after myself. Finally, nobody will scoff at the name Brandon Kirk, because it is not only the name of a totally real space captain but also a totally great spaceship. The jerks over at the Milky Way Copy Hut (where I had my new business cards printed) will have to eat their words once the name Brandon Kirk is synonymous with either &ldquo;War Hero&rdquo; or at least &ldquo;Functional Spaceship.&rdquo; I know my therapist, Dr. Wendle, would tell me to stop taking others&rsquo; comments so personally, and I am trying to do that. Those guys were jerks, and that&rsquo;s fine. I am okay with others making comments directed at me. Everything is okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The USS Brandon Kirk, in full military deployment.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>My new crew checked in today. They&rsquo;re all male (or at least malien). That&rsquo;s fine. I am okay with that. I have to revise my Dream Girlfriend Plan, but that will be much easier now that I&rsquo;m a Space Captain (and have the same name as a Real Spaceship). I&rsquo;m sure my crew was assigned to my ship based on their aptitude and ability to work together, not just generated at random. Dr. Wendle is always telling me to remember that our lives are the product of our own choices, and not - despite my theories or perhaps delusions otherwise - just a series of randomly generated encounters and events with no real connection or causation involved. I&rsquo;m sure we will all do just great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m getting to know the new team. I assigned Sem to the helm, because that&rsquo;s where he was when I came aboard. I needed somebody I could trust at the shield terminal, obviously, so I sent the other human there. It&rsquo;s not a race thing - he&rsquo;s white. I don&rsquo;t know what the Hell kind of name Rafn is, though. That&rsquo;s fine. I will learn to be okay with having a crew member called Rafn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two aliens aboard. Willow is some sort of crazy electricity monster, so I put him as far from me as possible, in the engine room. Finally, there&rsquo;s Junpeng. I&rsquo;m absolutely not afraid of him or his crazy-ass name, and I let him do what he asked to do - man the weapons - because he obviously has a natural proclivity to do that. I&rsquo;m not afraid of him. I am not afraid of his arms which are basically just four foot long blades, or the fact that the only personal items he brought on board consist of raw meat and the latest issue of Forbes Magazine. That&rsquo;s fine. I will learn to be okay with living with a creature that personifies my two biggest fears, giant blade monsters and investment banking. As my therapist has pointed out, other people&rsquo;s financial decisions have no bearing on me, so I need to just relax and try not to dwell on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the crew in place and the power systems allocated, the USS Brandon Kirk and her captain - me, Brandon Kirk - set off on our first big mission, which is important, I think. So, I wasn&rsquo;t exactly paying attention to the mission briefing. That&rsquo;s fine. I spent the time working on the name of my new ship, which is how I came up with the great ship name Brandon Kirk. It works on so many levels, you see. I&rsquo;m sure my therapist would use it as a sign of my supposed &ldquo;narcissistic tendencies,&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s a reason I didn&rsquo;t bring Dr. &ldquo;Broken Record&rdquo; Wendle onto my spaceship. I shouldn&rsquo;t say that about her. I&rsquo;m sorry, Dr. Wendle. You probably have good reason to point out my many narcissistic tendencies and crippling negativity. No, I am okay with myself. I am a powerful Space Captain, now. I am a successful person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;m not actually sure what we&rsquo;re doing out here. That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m okay with that. As Dr. Wendle would say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t focus on what you can&rsquo;t do - be proud of what you can.&rdquo; So I can&rsquo;t figure out what exactly my mission is. I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t something vitally important, since I&rsquo;m kinda new to this whole thing and I just have a pretty basic ship with a completely inexperienced crew. That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;saving the galaxy&rdquo; or anything of that sort. I will just focus on what I can. My ship has four basic lasers - I like to just call them lasers, I don&rsquo;t see the need to focus on the fact that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;basic&rdquo; lasers - so obviously our main mission is to shoot things with lasers. We will set off to find something that we can shoot lasers at.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk2.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The first encounter of the USS Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Aha! We took one faster than light jump and came across a poor sap needing help. This light came up on my dashboard indicating that someone was in distress (I call it the distress signal). My therapist told me that when I feel down on myself I should try to focus on helping others, so off we went to the source of the signal. I&rsquo;m . . . not down on myself. I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s what my therapist told me. I mean, my bed on this ship is more firm than my one at home, and I forgot to requisition any evening primrose oil supplements for the ship so my fatty acid levels have been imbalanced . . . Um, everything is fine, except for this poor sap sending out their distress call. They need help. I am okay, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there it was, this small ship struggling to maneuver through an asteroid belt. I disregarded my first thought which was, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you have just gone over the asteroid belt?&rdquo; As Dr. Wendle would say, that&rsquo;s just &ldquo;stinking thinking.&rdquo; I tried to see if we could just shoot some of the asteroids with our lasers - that being our mission, and all - but the crew assured me it would be impossible for some reason. I ordered Sem to take the ship into the field and escort the poor sap to safety. Obviously what this situation needed was a giant, marginally maneuverable spaceship getting in the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk3.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Let&rsquo;s just chalk this one up as a wash.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s fine. I am okay with the fact that the ship was embedded into an asteroid and exploded and nobody survived. My therapist told me to stop blaming others for my problems, and so I will try my best to do that even though I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was Sem&rsquo;s fault. I do have to give my guys credit for being quick on the draw with those salvage operations, though. We dug ten scrap out of that asteroid before heading on our way. I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Wendle would tell me to &ldquo;look on the bright side.&rdquo; The bright side here is that we got ten pieces of scrap metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, okay, then. I have to go sit under my UV lamp for a while. The Brandon Kirk is currently a bit too far from any stars, so I&rsquo;m not getting enough natural sunlight in my cabin. If I don&rsquo;t get enough UV exposure my vitamin D-6 levels will go down. Then I won&rsquo;t be able to sleep, and that means the next time we encounter a serious decision like we saw today (one based purely on the skill and quick reaction of myself and my crew, not entirely on random chance, of course) I won&rsquo;t be able to make the lightning quick decisions that save lives. Well, today&rsquo;s decision didn&rsquo;t save any lives, but that&rsquo;s fine. I am okay with the decisions I made today. Well, I am unhappy that I forgot to pack my white noise machine, but my cabin is close enough to the reactor that I should be okay.

Nope, now it&rsquo;s just louder, again. Whatever. Dear . . . um, Log. The mission is going so great. Well, okay, I don&rsquo;t actually know what my mission was, but that&rsquo;s fine. I have accepted that, and decided to just let my mission find me. As my therapist, Dr. Wendle would say, I&rsquo;m going to just focus on the little victories.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Business as usual here on the USS Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Life is just fine aboard the Brandon Kirk. Well, okay, there are a few things that I will need to remember in the future. For example, when I am leaving the medbay through the port-most doors, I have to remember to turn right instead of left. Turning right will take me to the Air Circulation control room. Turning left will take me into the unsurvivable vacuum of space. It&rsquo;s just little things. Thankfully, the ship has systems in place to prevent anyone from being sucked into space if someone opens one of those external doors. Still, it gets very cold. It also gets very hard to breathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we continued to venture forth through space, jumping from system to system in search of things to shoot with lasers. Arriving at one system, we happened to run into an automated scout ship protecting some sort of storage cache inside a nebula.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk4.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The USS Brandon Kirk&rsquo;s first hostile encounter.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dangerous nature of the nebula diminished the capacity of our reactor, so a few of our systems couldn&rsquo;t get power. Fortunately, we had plenty of power for our lasers. &ldquo;Blast it out of the sky!&rdquo; I commanded. Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t sound that heroic. Actually I said something like, &ldquo;fire the lasers at it!&rdquo; My therapist told me to start telling the truth more about things I have done, so I will do that. I need to be more honest with others, and I will then be more honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, fine, I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;fire the lasers&rdquo; either. I&rsquo;m sorry. What I actually said was, &ldquo;Oh God! Kill it! Kill that thing! What is it! Kill it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk5.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The automated scout with disabled weapons.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Junpeng was somehow able to control the lasers even though his arms are just swords. We disabled the enemy weapon system, so it was unable to shoot any lasers back at us. That was a really great thing, because I prefer lasers to be heading away from me, not at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk6.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Destruction of the automated scout.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With a few more shots, we put an end to the craft. Using my vast intellect, I outsmarted this hostile foe. Well, okay, it was just an automated defense robot, and it didn&rsquo;t have any shields and was actually really easy to kill. That&rsquo;s fine. I will take this victory with any others because it is a far better action to remember than almost killing myself by going through the wrong door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We salvaged what we could from the storage cache, which was a bit of fuel, a couple missiles, and 15 scrap. It was, therefore, about as fruitful as watching those poor saps collide with an asteroid yesterday. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m supposed to take a lesson away from that, or what that lesson might be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This nebula we had found was simply full of things to shoot with our lasers. Well, some of those things were just bits of rock and other debris, but that didn&rsquo;t mean they were any less susceptible to our lasers. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk7.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Another hostile encounter.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually we came across another drone. This one was a bit more tough than the first, but we were out of the dangerous energy fields of the nebula, and could therefore utilise the full potential of the Brandon Kirk&rsquo;s systems. I quickly ordered that we enable the shields. Well, actually I ordered that we run away, but Sem let me know that we couldn&rsquo;t get away from the drone until the FTL drives were charged. That is fine, though. I was not afraid of being shot at by an automated assault robot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk8.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The Brandon Kirk finds yet another success.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>And why should we have been afraid? Truly, nothing could withstand the power of our mighty (basic) lasers. Well, to be fair we had yet to face anything with a sentient brain, but whatever. Sure we took a couple hits, but we barely had a scratch. We destroyed the thing before our FTL drives were even charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that I was watching the FTL status the entire battle, or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk9.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>A poor, naive pirate tries to hustle the mighty Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon enough we left the comfortable protection of the nebula and we came across some joker trying to collect a &ldquo;toll&rdquo; at an FTL beacon. Sure, friend, we&rsquo;ll just pay your silly scrap toll to head through this empty system. I mean, 17 scrap is a pretty paltry sum. All we have to do is crash a ship into an asteroid and we&rsquo;ll get that. We will just ignore that skull and cross-bones (or for whatever reason, octopus and cross-bones), and hand over our hard earned scrap. Or, you know, we could SHOOT YOU WITH LASERS!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk10.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Battle with the hostile space pirate begins.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brandon Kirk is definitely a very formidable warship. Of course, this filthy space pirate (are space pirates filthy?) did have a drone with them, which was a new experience for me. It had a tiny little beam weapon which couldn&rsquo;t even penetrate our shields. What a pathetic, filthy space pirate this was (it&rsquo;s just seems that there isn&rsquo;t that much in space to make a pirate filthy). I knew this was going to be a cakewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk11.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The Brandon Kirk sustains damage, with shields down.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, actually, the space pirate did have a space missile launcher. Missiles will just go right through the shields like they weren&rsquo;t there at all - like the shields weren&rsquo;t there, not the missile. So if they launch a missile at our shield generator, then our shields will go down, and then their stupid drone can begin shooting us. Also the missiles can set the ship on fire, so that&rsquo;s also a problem. Anyway, exactly that happened. Our shields went down, and also our engines caught on fire. Thankfully Willow had equipment to put out the fire, and Rafn set about fixing the shields.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk12.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>More damage is suffered on the Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Then they shot a missile at our sensors, which meant I couldn&rsquo;t see anything on the ship (except for rooms that had a crew member in them). That&rsquo;s fine. I didn&rsquo;t need to see anything in those rooms, anyway. There&rsquo;s nothing interesting happening anywhere except the room where the laser controls are.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk13.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>. . . and more damage.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So then they shot at the room where the laser controls are. That&rsquo;s fine. One of the lasers was put offline, but we still had three. Junpeng got to work fixing things, as Willow set about fixing the engines and Rafn made sure the shields were back up. Oh, also the cockpit was damaged, so Sem had to fix that before we could maneuver at all. This meant that our only way of not being hit by missiles - that is, flying out of the way of them - was gone. All in all, things were not going too great for the Brandon Kirk. That&rsquo;s fine, though. I am okay with challenge. As Dr. Wendle would say, that which doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger. It&rsquo;s just that missiles could very easily kill us.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk14.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Brandon Kirk turns the tide of the battle.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the best defense is a good offense, or something like that, right? We still had three working lasers. Alone, a laser couldn&rsquo;t penetrate a ship&rsquo;s shield, but three of them can overwhelm shields and punch right through to the gooey, delicious center. I had Junpeng put them to work disabling the enemy shields, and then we shot them in their stupid missile launcher that I had really begun to hate.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk15.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>A hard fought victory for the Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>And by the skin of our teeth, we (the Brandon Kirk and her captain, me, Brandon Kirk) vanquished that dumb filthy space pirate (they are filthy in the &ldquo;I hate them and their stupid missile launcher&rdquo; sense) and collected their scrap in our, well, whatever we keep all this scrap in. Is it a scrap tank? Is it some sort of pouch? I don&rsquo;t know. Our scrap pouch was now nice and full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the Brandon Kirk has made short work of not just automated drones, but also backwater, two-bit space thugs trying to bully small ships for milk money. Well, fine, so we kind of had a hard time with that last one, but we learned some valuable lessons. Mainly we learned about how much I hate missiles (a lot).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk16.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Yet another victory for the Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So when we came across another filthy space pirate (their ships do look pretty filthy), this time dangerously close to a star, we knew just how to take them down. So we did take them down. We barely took any damage doing it, so we obviously had things under control, now.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk17.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Now the Brandon Kirk is on fire (again).</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, okay, there was the matter of the ship being on fire. That&rsquo;s fine, though. We were too close to the star, so solar flares were setting things on fire. The FTL drive was still charging, so we couldn&rsquo;t just go somewhere else. These fires had to be put out before they spread to important systems, like the room where the laser controls are. I was going to send Willow in there with his trusty fire extinguisher, but then I remembered something I had learned - something involving doors . . . and space!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk18.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Brandon Kirk&rsquo;s cunning has saved Brandon Kirk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Aha! I am a hero. By venting the room on fire into space, the fire had no oxygen left to breath, so it all went out. I have to remember to tell my therapist about this, because it will totally shut her up about telling me to be less selfish.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/brandonkirk/bk19.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The fire is put out.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a situation where I could have easily sent somebody into a raging inferno, but instead I did something that made them not have to do that. I might have saved Willow&rsquo;s life, there. Well, actually, I was the one who decided to fly this close to the sun in the first place, but it&rsquo;s hard to see this navigation control, and I couldn&rsquo;t really tell that would happen. It&rsquo;s fine. Small victories, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To be continued . . .</em></p>",

      "text": "<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to see or hear people talking about the upcoming Presidential Election everywhere you go. Though it does get a bit annoying, it&rsquo;s refreshing to not hear people talking about Kardashians or Kate Middleton&rsquo;s wedding for a change. If you were hoping that DenyConformity.com would be a place where you could get away from the Presidential Debate coverage, I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you. However, I think I might be taking an analytical angle that you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else. It occurred to me while watching the last debate, the one in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What kinds of pens are the candidates using?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/364/Pen_Reviews_Prologue'>interested</a> in pens, of course. I like to collect them and compare them. Examining exactly what pens Obama and Romney chose to bring to take notes during the debate made watching the debate slightly less boring, and also might give a bit of insight into the candidates themselves, if you&rsquo;re so undecided that you&rsquo;ll take absolutely any piece of differentiating information to make a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s throw a bit of Presidential trivia out there. When a president signs a big bill or other document, it&rsquo;s tradition to actually use <a href='http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1974490,00.html'>a bunch of pens to make the signature</a>. I guess they just carefully make bits of each letter with each pen. Once it&rsquo;s done, the President has a bunch of unique souvenirs they can hand out to important people related to the document. Lyndon Johnson apparently used over 75 pens to sign the Civil Rights act in 1964, and gave one of the first ones to Martin Luther King Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens13.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Bush deviated from this tradition, of course, because he signed all of his bills with crayon.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The President will obviously use special pens for these occasions, not just some off-the-shelf clicky-top. They&rsquo;re high-class capped numbers, with the President&rsquo;s signature engraved on the side. It turns out that Obama&rsquo;s pens are somewhat unique, aside from the fact that they have his name on them. The engraved signature is <a href=\r\nhttp://www.joehribar.com/blog/2009/12/18/totally-random-presidential-pens/'>right-side-up</a> only when the pen is held in the left hand. Obama is left handed, just like all of the coolest people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the debates, though. It happens that the third Presidential Debate is the best one to take a look at. The first debate placed the candidates at big podiums, which made it impossible to see what they were using, and the second, &ldquo;town hall&rdquo; debate had the candidates standing and walking about, not sitting down carefully taking notes. For the last debate, the candidates were sitting at the same table, with nothing but their notepads and pens in front of them. Finally, there will be no secrets about the candidates&rsquo; preferred writing utensils.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>While the candidates prattle on about their continuing rhetoric, we can see what pens they like to use.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Mitt Romney. He&rsquo;s a businessman, and according to his debate rhetoric, he&rsquo;s looking to make the government more simple and cut out anything unnecessary or expensive. We don&rsquo;t have to go into the facts and figures of what he said at the debate or elsewhere. The point is that he&rsquo;s rooted in business, and - being a very rich man - check writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These principles are actually kind of reflected in his pen choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens2.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is a closeup of the pen Romney was using at the last debate.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Romney was using a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BA5WKU/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002BA5WKU&linkCode=as2&tag=denyconfocom-20'>Uni-ball 207 RT with blue ink</a><img src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002BA5WKU' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='display: inline; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' />. It&rsquo;s a very straight forward, simple pen. It also happens to be fantastic (I found one on a chair in college and I still have it and enjoy using it). It&rsquo;s part of Uni-ball&rsquo;s Signo line, which means it has archival, &ldquo;helps prevent check fraud&rdquo; gel ink. It&rsquo;s not quite as smearable as the <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/391/A_Zebra_Three-Way'>Zebra gel I tested</a> a while back, and the pen itself has a really smooth, dependable quality. That being said, there&rsquo;s no pretense about it - it&rsquo;s all very light plastic. It has a clear body to see the level of ink in the replaceable cartridge, and the only design embellishment is on the clip, which features the Uni-ball and Signo logos. All in all, it&rsquo;s a very good choice of pen for a pragmatic, down to earth businessman.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens3.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Another look at Romney&rsquo;s pen, with some of the archival scribbles it produced.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Uni-ball does produce four point sizes for the 207, and also makes a 0.7mm &ldquo;needle point&rdquo; version as well. I&rsquo;m guessing Mitt was using the standard 0.7mm medium point. Now, there are blue and light-blue versions, but it looks like Mitt has the regular, conservative blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens4.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is the Uni-ball 207 RT, for reference.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So how about Barack Obama, then? Obama is pretty much what you could cite as the classic politician. He went to law school, and practiced as a lawyer for many years before moving into politics. He has worked for his position, moving through first state and then national elected offices. He&rsquo;s very well spoken, and pretty verbose, at that. He&rsquo;s earned a reputation as being a very attractive and picturesque man. His image is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens5.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here is Obama holding his debate pen.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as easy to recognize as Romney&rsquo;s choice, but after examining some pictures I have determined that Obama was actually also using a Uni-ball in the debate. Unlike Romney, however, Obama had a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JKR4DM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000JKR4DM&linkCode=as2&tag=denyconfocom-20'>Uni-ball Vision Elite,</a><img src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000JKR4DM' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='display: inline; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /> a pretty classy capped rollerball. The Vision Elite is not one of Uni-ball&rsquo;s Signo gel pens, but it does have archival quality, pigment-based, water resistant ink. That sounds like gel to me, but who am I to say? I would say that a nice, comfortable rollerball pen would certainly be a logical choice for somebody known to be verbose. Also, for a career politician who is careful to maintain a classy mystique, nothing beats a sleek, black, capped pen. The claim that the Vision Elite won&rsquo;t leak on an airplane is certainly not a bad thing for Obama, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens6.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here is the best view we get of Obama&rsquo;s pen, but we can clearly see the characteristic, circular &ldquo;uni-ball Vision ELITE&rdquo; branding and clear butt.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve used a Vision Elite before, but I don&rsquo;t have any here to refresh my memory. It will definitely go on my list to check out, then. It is a rollerball, though, which means it&rsquo;s very smooth and designed for writing. It&rsquo;s more substantial than the 207, and has a heavier, more imposing (for a pen, anyway) presence. The Vision Elite is also, for what it&rsquo;s worth, a tad bit more expensive than the 207.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens7.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It&rsquo;s surprisingly hard to find a picture of this thing with the cap on, instead of stuck on the back end, but here it is.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pictures of the second, &ldquo;town hall style&rdquo; debate show that the candidates had the same pen choices there, which implies that these really were chosen by the candidates, or perhaps even their own personal pens. I doubt we&rsquo;ll ever really know, but it does seem like these were more than just a last minute, &ldquo;oh, here, better take a pen and paper with you on stage&rdquo; situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens10.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>There&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s Vision Elite, while the candidates were discussing five point plans and binders full of things.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, It&rsquo;s interesting (or incredibly boring, I suppose, if you aren&rsquo;t a weirdo like I am) that in the last debate, the moderator, Bob Schieffer, was also apparently using a Uni-ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens8.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It&rsquo;s tough to find a good picture of his pen, but there are plenty of his stern moderator face.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Schieffer&rsquo;s pen has a very characteristic cap (it was, like Obama&rsquo;s, a capped rollerball), and at first I thought it was a <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/399/The_Pentel_Hybrid_Technica'>Pentel Hybrid Technica</a>. However, Schieffer&rsquo;s pen was blue, and the Technica only comes in black. Looking through Uni-ball&rsquo;s selection, however, it seems that Schieffer had a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JNI0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006JNI0&linkCode=as2&tag=denyconfocom-20'>blue Uni-ball Gel Grip</a><img src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00006JNI0' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='display: inline; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' />, another in the Signo family of gel pens. I don&rsquo;t know what this pen says about Bob Schieffer, and I don&rsquo;t care to explore it too much since he isn&rsquo;t running for President. However, one interesting fact about this pen is that I can&rsquo;t seem to find it in packs of less than 12 or so. I guess Schieffer likes a pen that comes in bulk, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens9.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Good thing, since they&rsquo;re apparently delicious.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps all these Uni-balls are part of some grand pen-related conspiracy, or a complex product placement. Considering nobody else is talking about it, it probably isn&rsquo;t. Uni-ball, for the record, is part of the same huge corporation that owns Sharpie, Papermate, and <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/378/The_Parker_Jotter'>Parker</a>. If the candidates were wanting to reassure us that they weren&rsquo;t going to support corporate interests, their pens don&rsquo;t really help their case. Who knows, maybe Sanford helped underwrite the Commision on Presidential Debates. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Whatever the case, perhaps the most interesting thing of all is that these two men who seem to disagree on so many things have at least this one thing in common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the Vice Presidential Debate, you ask? Well, I looked into that, as well. I won&rsquo;t analyse them, since it&rsquo;s already very late, but here they are, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens11.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Paul Ryan makes a point while flanked by two simple pens.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Ryan used a pair of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E34OUS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002E34OUS&linkCode=as2&tag=denyconfocom-20'>blue Papermate Flairs</a><img src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002E34OUS' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='display: inline; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /> (I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s what they are, anyway). Perhaps the blue thing was a campaign choice. The Flair is a simple felt tip pen. They&rsquo;re unique in the debates in that respect, and though they aren&rsquo;t from Uni-ball, they&rsquo;re still under the Sanford umbrella, so it&rsquo;s all in the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/presidentialpens/prespens12.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Joe Biden is the white to Obama&rsquo;s black. I&rsquo;m talking about pens, here, of course.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe Biden actually has the same pen as Obama, in white instead of black. I suppose that&rsquo;s awkwardly appropriate, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s a very clean, articulate pen, indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I find all this more interesting that most of the actual debate talk. Maybe you can go out and pick up your favorite candidate&#039;s pen, and feel like you&#039;re part of the team. Whatever the case, I hope you found this any bit as interesting as I did. Also, you&#039;re welcome for not making any 'uni-ball' jokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I guess I should specify that all of these pictures were from Google Image search, since I have no real journalistic integrity to uphold.</em></p>",

      "text": "<p>Hello. A many years ago I got a huge collection of MAME roms off the electronic Internet. MAME stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. So these are old (and slightly less old) arcade games from a many many years ago. I&rsquo;m bored tonight, so I&rsquo;m going to select a few random ones and tell you about them. Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Psychic 5</strong>\r\n<br />1987, by Jaleco</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/psyc0003.png' />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Select Esper&rdquo; is what I&rsquo;m prompted upon hitting start on this side- and vertical- scrolling platformer. I didn&rsquo;t see any Espers on the screen, but not knowing what one is I wouldn&rsquo;t have known if one was there. I didn&rsquo;t have much time to figure it out, though, because the game started.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/psyc0005.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Select Esper</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m apparently a small boy lost in some sort of old Japanese Haunted House (maybe that&rsquo;s racist - it&rsquo;s of an asian persuasion). I can jump with one button and smash things with apparently a hammer, because all boys have hammers, right?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I smashed what must have been a priceless antique pot and there was a smiley face inside. I picked that up, like you do, and traveled onward to seek more of these things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a witch randomly flying by, and what appears to be an angry clock puking smaller, less angry clocks at me. My hammer makes short work of the smaller clocks, and I can use my &ldquo;because this is a video game&rdquo; ridiculously high jumping ability to make it up to the platform with the larger one. I don&rsquo;t want to go near that monstrosity, but if I were puking clocks (or for that matter anything), I&rsquo;d want a boy to put me out of misery with his hammer, too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/psychic5.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>I&rsquo;m a hero, I guess.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so my hammer just dazed the thing for a second, and he pretty quickly woke up and turned me into an angel. There&rsquo;s a lesson in there somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/psyc0000.png' />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course I have another life, so this time I give the clock monster a wider berth. I find a few more priceless antique pots, but they contain what looks like jewels and other valuables. Why the first one had a smiley face in it I have no idea. Stupid clock monster cornered me and made me another ghost. I&rsquo;m not very good at platformers, as it happens.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Life number three begins with great promise. I got past my timekeeping nemesis and ignored the witch thing because she apparently doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything. The highlight of the game was finding another smiley face. I then proceeded to spend a solid 90 seconds trying to jump on a moving platform.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/psyc0002.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>I&rsquo;m really not good at platformers.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the story would make more sense if I had played Psychics 1 through 4. I bet they explain what Esper is and how one selects it. This game seems to mainly be about seeking smiles while you avoid the inevitability of time. Hits too close to home for me. Next.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><strong>Ms. Pac Man</strong>\r\n<br />1980 / 81 - Midway MFG CO</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to skip this random selection because showing a game people have heard of defeats the purpose of making fun of obscure old arcade games. Then I realized &ldquo;who cares&rdquo; and just played it anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/mspa0008.png' />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this game you play as a lemon meringue pie with a fetching red bow and lipstick. You have to make your way around a maze eating tiny white dots and avoiding four differently colored ghosts. You can eat one of four larger white dots to make all the ghosts the same color and susceptible to your gaping, yellow maw. When eaten, the ghosts&rsquo; eyes travel back to their paddock in the center of the level and they come back to life - er, death. They&rsquo;re ghosts, so I don&rsquo;t know why you thought you could kill them by hitting them with a pie.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/mspa0004.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>A female pie, in fact.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also there are cherries, so I guess she aspires to be a cherry pie instead of lemon. I&rsquo;m not sure how the ghosts fit into the pie metaphor.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t my first time around the maze with old Ms. Pie Man, so I know what I&rsquo;m doing (also it isn&rsquo;t a platformer, so I don&rsquo;t have to waste any time trying to jump onto anything). We all know your only escape from this glowing red, ghost-infested hell (I guess that&rsquo;s just regular Hell, actually) is by collecting all those tiny dots. So I do that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/mspa0004.png' />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Which of course prompts the game to reset and it all starts over again. So ultimately, a young pie&rsquo;s attempts to feel good about herself and actually accomplish anything meaningful are completely futile. Again, too close to real life for me. Also that incessant &ldquo;wakka wakka&rdquo; sound is pretty excruciating after like five seconds. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><strong>Ginga NinkyouDen</strong>\r\n<br />Unknown year (it&rsquo;s in Japanese or something) - Jaleco</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0008.png' />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking. Here&rsquo;s some weird Japanese arcade game about who knows what. Let&rsquo;s do this, Ginga NinkyouDen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So within about five seconds of pressing start I see what is apparently the Macguffin for this game (some floating garbage or something) fly away and then some asshole hits me in the face with a pie. Literally, all this happens before I can even move.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ginganin.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>It&rsquo;s actually an endless stream of these pie-armed vixens.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to run away from them, into what is obviously a room behind this dude, is apparently impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0001.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>I just realized that building is a face.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the police station apparently closed, this horrible town has just fallen into chaos. Why must all arcade games be about pie? Finally I get my bearings and jump over one of the obnoxious pie vixens. Then I run . . . into . . .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0002.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>wat</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now I&rsquo;m fighting some red thing and also there are Godzillas falling down a hole behind it. Ginga NinkyouDen, you really are full of surprises. I timidly step toward the thing and wail on the button that makes the little dude that I am swing his fist a dangerously small distance in front of his giant head. The red thing surrenders like a chump, and I am ready for my next challenge. Godzilla parade.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another one of those red dudes pops up, scratching menacingly at the pavement in front of him. I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the little badger thing if it weren&rsquo;t for all those Godzillas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0004.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class=&#039;caption&#039;>An endless stream of Godzillas.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I strike out with my single fist attack (my only attack, unless you count a &ldquo;because this is a video game&rdquo; ridiculously high jump as an attack). It turns out the Godzillas are just as susceptible to my fury as the red thing, and a couple of them fall to my cunning strategy. I even avoid the one that inexplicably attacks me from the left side of the screen. Then I accidentally fall into the hole (platformer), and get killed by some sort of Jason-looking dude with a plasma gun that&rsquo;s also a chainsaw.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0005.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>That escalated quickly.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With my next of the obligatory three lives I was able to dive right into the hole and charge down the hall toward those Jason-looking dudes. When no Jason-looking dudes showed up I was a little thrown, but then they did so it all worked out. Then they pulled that &ldquo;showing up on the left side&rdquo; trick that the Godzillas pulled earlier, which was a bit more successful because these Jason-looking things can shoot at me. Not fair, Ginga NinkyouDen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Life number three went much further. I defeated a few Jason-looking dudes, punched some random guys in their underwear (I don&rsquo;t know how we got from plasma gun and chainsaw to boxer shorts), beat up a few more Godzillas, and then Rambo shot me with a rocket. Seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0006.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Bonus: Motorcycle Ninjas</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ginga NinkyouDen knows what I&rsquo;m looking for. That is to say, I have no idea what is going on, but I like that. Video games let you do things you wouldn&rsquo;t normally do, and today I punched a Godzilla and got chainsawed by a Jason-looking dude while an angry man in his underwear watched. The music isn&rsquo;t half-bad either - fast paced and innocuous enough to not be obnoxious. Overall, an excellent experience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img style='width: 448px' src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/arcades/ging0007.png' />\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Plus it features this babe in some capacity.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s enough for now. I&#039;ll probably do this again some time.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>Hello. A few days ago I posted a thing about some arcade games I played. Well, I was pretty bored that night, so I actually played a few more games than I had room to write about in a single post. Here are my thoughts about a couple more as they were pulled randomly from my library of obscure and old arcade games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tazz-Mania</strong>\r\n<br />1982 - Stern Electronics Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/tazm0002.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day before people really figured out what video games really were, people were free to experiment with all sorts of horrible and almost unplayable gameplay styles. I fear this is one of those experiments. From the early 80&rsquo;s graphics to the &ldquo;PULL STICK FOR INSTRUCTIONS&rdquo; message, I&rsquo;m not getting a good feeling about this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I figure I had better pull the stick to see what&rsquo;s up with this, and it shows me a laundry-list of different scores I can apparently get, followed by a screen explaining how the game works. The explanation proceeds to explode before I can read it. No matter, I&rsquo;m a long-time video game player and I basically have infinite quarters, so let&rsquo;s do this, Tazz Mania.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/tazmania.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>wat</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m some green thing, and there are a bunch of red . . . things, and there are some . . . yellow . . . face . . . things . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the yellow things touched me and we both exploded. Okay, lesson one: don&rsquo;t touch the yellow face things. What does any of this have to do with Tazmania? With my second &lsquo;up&rsquo; I discovered that I have some sort of gun! A gun that only shoots when I push a button and move in a direction, so I have to move toward the thing I&rsquo;m trying to shoot. Great. Also apparently this is &ldquo;The Face Room.&rdquo; Time to hunt me some faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/tazm0001.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I take out a few of the things before they finally get me. The walls are slowly closing in, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if those yellow face things take me alive. I&rsquo;ll spit hellfire from my gun or whatever at those damned monsters until they pry this little yellow line from my cold, green hands. Tell my green wife-thing or whatever and presumably smaller green children if I have them that I love them. I die like I lived - not really understanding what the Hell. Next.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>Bells & Wistles</strong>\r\n<br />or, apparently, <strong>&ldquo;Detana!! Twin Bee&rdquo;</strong>\r\n<br />1991 - Konami</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of many of my arcade roms that comes in multiple versions - in this case an American version and a Japanese one. Obviously I&rsquo;m going to choose the version with all the exclamation marks. Without a clear shtick for how I&rsquo;m going to make fun of this game, I&rsquo;ll just type out my thoughts as I have them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/detatwin.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I think this is one of those &ldquo;bullet hell&rdquo; games where you fly around with everything shooting at you and try not to die. It also apparently - from the attractor loop (you know, the gameplay that plays while waiting for some kid to plop in some quarters) - features shooting at a bell for some reason, so like 90% of the sounds spewing out of my speakers right now are this constant horrible lo-fi ringing bell sound. Let&rsquo;s get this over with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear God, just putting in quarters elicits an excruciating sound effect. I don&rsquo;t know why Konami would want to so immediately and severely punish someone for giving them money.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/deta0004.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Now there&rsquo;s some chick saying Japanese at me. I&rsquo;m starting to regret picking the Japanese version of this game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is some epic music, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re like 45 seconds in and she&rsquo;s still yapping away. That&rsquo;s a crazy long time for an arcade game to go without even an explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chick isn&rsquo;t even showing any skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/deta0000.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, the chick disappeared and now I&rsquo;m some sort of floating bubble-man with clouds around me. For a &ldquo;bullet hell&rdquo; game there sure aren&rsquo;t many bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can fix that pretty quick, since I can be a source of bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/deta0002.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I shot at a cloud and a bell popped out. Sure. I can keep shooting the bell and it travels along with me. Then some strawberries flew by in formation, followed by some turnips, and corn, and then a different kind of corn. Those are carrots, I guess? What the hell is going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/deta0001.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Then a raspberry appeared, summoning its juicy pods or whatever from the very sky around us. Flashing once, it shot at me, killing both me and the bell I had been taking with me this whole time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve lost the will to carry on. I&rsquo;m not sure if I had any to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I complained about games being too much like real life, but this is perhaps a bit too &ldquo;out there.&rdquo; Maybe if the sound effects and music weren&rsquo;t conspiring together to make me want to rip my own ears off and feed them to the designers of this game, I could stand it a bit longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think I&#039;ll go lay down for a bit, now.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>Hello. For a few years I&#039;ve had this collection of old arcade roms, computerized versions of arcade games from the 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s. The other night I was just super bored so I decided to play a few and write down my thoughts about them. You might remember that from when I already made two posts about it, or maybe this is the first one you&#039;ve read because it&#039;s pretty great. Anyway, here&#039;s another game I played and then wrote about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mutation Nation</strong>\r\n<br />1992 - SNK CORP OF AMERICA</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0016.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>In 1990, SNK released the Neo Geo, a cartridge-based console you could buy for your home or put inside an arcade machine. I&rsquo;ve never seen one of the consoles anywhere, but the arcades are still in use. Generally speaking, Neo Geo arcade games are the best arcade games. I&rsquo;m just informing you of that so you join me in my high expectations for this particular one. The chrome lettering and ominous skyline on the title screen should add to your high expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One standard on Neo Geo games is that they&rsquo;re all controlled with a stick and four buttons. Since it&rsquo;s a console it has to have pretty standardized controls. Most games didn&rsquo;t use all four buttons. I think it was required for games to have a sort &ldquo;how to play&rdquo; sequence where you see a magic floating finger push each button to show you what it does. That&rsquo;s a bit more handy than Tazz-mania, but it&rsquo;s not terribly necessary since this game has one button for jumping and another for kicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0018.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>And oh boy is there kicking! According to the attractor loop, there&rsquo;s going to be some pretty awesome feats of feets in my future.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0015.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>There&rsquo;s apparently also something called a &ldquo;Torneado attack.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutant Nation is an example of some genre they don&rsquo;t make much anymore, where you&rsquo;re a Bad Dude and you&rsquo;re beating up other Dudes of questionable Badness. In this game you play as a real Dude so Bad he has a pair of fists permanently hoisted in combat mode. While this probably makes a lot of things difficult - getting dressed, for instance - it surely leaves him uniquely suited to beating up, well, a nation of mutants I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0000.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Upon starting Stage 1, this building behind me immediate exploded. That really set a high bar for the rest of the Stage. Well, it set a high bar for excitement, but a pretty low bar for what&rsquo;s expected of me, effort-wise, if buildings are going to just explode around me from the sheer Badness of my Dude. I think the Neo Geo also had an explosion requirement in its games, so Mutant Nation was doing reasonably well so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutnat.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>The first Dudes on the express train to Badville are some identically dressed triplets that fell from the sky all around me. SNK was trying to ease me into the whole mutant nation, I guess. In usual &ldquo;beat-em-up&rsquo; fashion, all three of the dudes casually walked off screen where I couldn&rsquo;t see them. Maybe if I knew how to do that Torneado attack I&rsquo;d have been able to bring them back over to me for some kicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe they were just three Dudes trying to make their way in this nation of mutants and some jerk with a leather jacket and blue jeans had just blown up their apartment building. The only context Mutant Nation gives is that you are a Dude in some sort of Mutant Nation (titular, in fact), and since I was apparently a normal looking (albeit Bad) Dude, I have to assume that I was the invader. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0001.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Soon my first taste of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; mutant arrived. He had like a fish head with tentacles coming out of it. I punched him until he was flung off the screen from the force of my fist (fistforce). Was he just walking to work? Why was he wearing kneepads? These are questions I don&rsquo;t think this game has answers to. All I knew is that I simply had to collect that glowing &ldquo;B&rdquo; on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon more of those fish dudes showed up. They looked hungry, so I gave them a taste of my knuckle sandwich. I was promised some serious kicking and so far I&rsquo;d primarily only seen punching. I was really starting to root for those mutants. The few fish dudes that didn&rsquo;t get knocked off the screen entirely fall to the ground and dissolve into a pool of some sort of green sludge. I was murdering these people for no reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0002.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Then this pointy dude showed up. I&rsquo;m not sure what his role was in this mutant society, but he had some sort of strange joint condition and the most awkwardly pointy shoes I&rsquo;ve ever seen. My strategy was to keep punching him until he exploded. That strategy panned out. Still, this pointy dude seemed pretty important. He obviously had a lot going on, and I&rsquo;m now worried there&rsquo;s some weird-looking lady out there with a collection of strangely pointy children who won&rsquo;t get to see their father anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I eventually figured out that you can charge up your power somehow and unleash it in a burst of energy. Maybe I was a mutant after all! I wasn&rsquo;t some racist jerk invading a country to beat up innocent locals, I was just a serial murderer targeting his own kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least, I hoped so. Alas, though, I was a regular Bad Dude. That glowing &ldquo;B&rdquo; I found is what gave me that power. Now I was using their own weapons against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0004.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>My fists continued their quest to crack some mutant bones, finding a few more of those triplets, some dudes that transformed into some sort of weasel things, and some guys that transformed into giant beetles only to charge directly offscreen never to be seen again. Life is diverse and fascinating in Mutant Nation, and I was determined to bring that diversity down by the fistfull.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0007.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>The second boss was a guy with like tentacle arms I guess and a pack of green dogs. They all got the punching of their lives - specifically the end of their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that many of the buildings seen in the background are in various levels of decay or halted construction. Had the Mutant Nation economy been crippled by the invasion of Bad Dudes murdering them? If only a recession could be defeated by punching it. I&rsquo;d put an end to that really quickly. I marched into one of the buildings because these mutants couldn&rsquo;t cower in their puny slums forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0008.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d wandered into an old art museum. Most of the paintings were of Dali-esque still lifes or landscapes. This nation of mutants was desperate to find an escape in fantasies as bizarre and twisted as they were. The party was over, though. There was to be no art appreciation while this Bad Dude had anything to say about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0009.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>The next room was full of multiple copies of the same statue of some perfectly sculpted specimen of man. Poor mutant children must walk through this room, a look of shameful confusion on their tentacle-laden fish-faces, wondering why these statues look so different from them and all their friends (except I guess their friends who are all apparently just copies of that one guy).  There was no time for all that, though, because I had to punch this huge dude a whole bunch of times. Punch him hard. Maybe he was the art curator, or perhaps he was just a really big guy trying to enjoy his day off.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0010.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>His mutant power was apparently &ldquo;being Odin.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This guy sure was big, but that just left me right at crotch-punching level, so I took advantage of that - many times. He jumped at me and the entire floor buckled underneath us. Some curator he was, destroying his own museum. Still, you have to admire his fashion sense. Where other mutants are content with t-shirts and knee pads (the knee pad industry was apparently doing quite well in Mutant Nation), this guy was going full skull-armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0013.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I kept punching him until his armor grew a head and starts trying to bite me. This fight was getting weird (even for a nation of mutants), so I stopped screwing around and started punching him extra hard. By that, of course, I mean &ldquo;used several continues&rdquo; because I am, after all, not the best at video games. Good thing my mom gave me lots of quarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/arcades/mutn0014.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>Sated with mutant killing in this Area, the Bad Dude cracked his knuckles and pointed defiantly offscreen. What was he pointing at? This game only raises questions, never answers. I had lost my taste for mutant blood, and found I had a hard time venturing onward without more impetus than a flashing icon shouting &ldquo;GO&rdquo; at me. Perhaps someday we will find peace with the inhabitants of Mutant Nation, but as long as there Dudes eager to prove how Bad they are, I fear there will always be senseless violence and destruction. I encourage you all to contact your local senators and representatives to raise awareness of this awful state of affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound design and music were perfectly adequate.</p>\r\n\r\n",

In that time, I&#039;ve learned that things can get pretty boring, especially in those couple summer months when everybody just wants to go outside. If you also work in an office with an indeterminate number of coworkers, there&#039;s one sure-fire way around the doldrums. <em>Pranks.</em> Here are some suggestions, in order of when I thought of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cut the power lines to somebody&#039;s office. No, I don&#039;t mean flip the breaker or something - I&#039;m talking that scene from early in <em>Die Hard</em> when the big German dude saws all the phone lines clean through.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Cubicle walls are hollow. Fill somebody&#039;s cubicle panels with milk. It takes a few days to pay off, but oh boy is it great.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Hide in a cabinet in the break room. Every time somebody sets a fork or spoon out and opens the fridge, quietly grab the spoon or fork and hide it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Follow someone home and take pictures of them in private moments, then set those pictures as their desktop background while they&#039;re in the bathroom.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Get an honest afternoon&#039;s work in - but give somebody else credit. Your boss will be expecting that much work from then on, so that guy&#039;s just screwed.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Dress up like your boss and go around telling everybody they can take off early.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Clog every toilet in the building. When everybody goes to see what the fuck, set all their desktop backgrounds as pictures of you clogging every toilet.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Rename just totally every file in somebody&#039;s computer.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Take something off a dude&#039;s desk, and then send them a picture of it in front of the building. When they go to get it, set their desktop background as a picture of, I don&#039;t know, your junk or something.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Unleash a handful of rats on the floor. If you don&#039;t know how to get your hands full of rats, you&#039;re on your own.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Work from home? No problem. Just get yourself a cat, and it&#039;s like somebody&#039;s constantly playing pranks on <em>you</em> - usually involving poop.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>With a small pin or needle, poke a hole in the bottom of somebody&#039;s diet coke cans, so when they grab their afternoon 'pick-me-up' they&#039;re all empty.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Pour honey or syrup into somebody&#039;s keyboard, then release a horde of ants on their desk.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Keep replacing something in the break room with laxatives. Give cryptic clues about what.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Set somebody&#039;s desktop background to a picture of you setting their desktop background. When they&#039;re changing it back, take a picture of it and set that as YOUR desktop background. That will really throw them off.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Remove the hydraulic fluid from someone&#039;s office chair. Do office chairs have hydraulic fluid? If not, just remove all of the bolts from someone&#039;s office chair, or saw like 9/10ths of the way through one of the legs or something. When the company charges him for breaking company property, scan the bill and set it as his desktop background.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Straight up set fire to everything.</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n",

      "title": "Lego: a (re-)introduction",
      "text": "<p>Lego is awesome. Really I could probably just say that and be done with it. I don&#039;t think anybody would have any arguments to the contrary, and if they did they suck and I hate them anyway. There&#039;s something so unique, so perfect, about those little pieces - and something so genius about their designers. If you do the math, with just two standard 4x2 bricks (probably the piece you are thinking of when you visualize the quintessential Lego piece), you can combine them in 24 different ways - that&#039;s just two pieces. Take six of those bricks, and you get almost one billion unique arrangements, give or take a few if you happen lose one in the couch or something. Now consider that &nbsp;in 2012 and 2013, the Lego Group produced about 3,600 unique pieces (according to the database on Rebrickable). Now further consider that any of those 3,600 pieces will be able to interact and interconnect with any of the 17,477 unique pieces that have been produced dating all the way back to the 50&#039;s. To put it plainly: pieces you could go out and buy today (or, for example, any of the thousands of pieces I have scattered around me as I write this) are fully compatible - perhaps even identical - to any pieces made over the last fifty years (including all the pieces that have been lost in the couch or the vacuum). Between the Lego Group&rsquo;s extensive attention to detail and dedication to their product&rsquo;s original thesis, the world of Lego offers countless adventures without restriction or limit, and what was once just a child&#039;s toy has evolved into the perfect hobby for adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always loved Lego. The majority of my childhood was spent building, playing with, organizing, thinking about, or losing Lego bricks. I can&#039;t fathom just how much time I spent flipping through Lego catalogues when I was a kid, memorizing any sets I had the slightest chance of getting some day, and trying to ignore the ones I knew I&#039;d never be able to afford - but obsessing over them anyway. If I had spent as much time studying, I don&#039;t know, physics or something as much as I studied the top of the line Lego sets from the mid 90&#039;s, I&#039;d have had a PhD by the time I was 14. Lego pieces were everything - literally - and though I strayed from time to time to things like Transformers or G.I.Joe, I always came back. I certainly wasn&#039;t alone, either. I doubt any child made it through the 90&#039;s without at least once shaking a wrapped Christmas present to listen for the unmistakable rattle that meant you had struck gold. That sound will always bring me back to that exciting worry-free time when a tiny little square of plastic could be anything. At the time it was certain that the Lego Group was forever, and those days would never end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the 2000&#039;s hit. It was a period of turmoil, both in my relationship with those little plastic bits, and for the bits themselves. The most casual research of Lego will turn up lots of information about what is considered the 'dark age' of the toy, around the early 2000&#039;s (probably as little as just opening Netflix might bring you to that <em>Inside Lego</em> documentary which details the struggles and eventual triumph of the Lego Group through the period). It&#039;s hard not to feel just a little responsible, really, considering the company was close to going under right around the same time that I had moved on in my life, to pointless and futile grownup pursuits (like computer games or girls). I wasn&#039;t a kid anymore, and so I just couldn&#039;t justify spending money on toys. It&#039;s a sentiment apparently reflected by most of Lego&#039;s major audience in the early 2000&#039;s, apparently driving the company to the verge of failure - except that they didn&#039;t fail, and no matter how much I tried to deny it, I was still in love. That enchanting rattle, that satisfying way in which those pieces fit, those years spent playing and collecting and dreaming and finding pieces in the vacuum will never leave me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After years (even decades) of denial, I came crawling back. The last several months has seen me spending quite a bit of time and money feeding my passion once again. Perhaps my resurgence has been fueled by the fantastic <em>The Lego Movie</em> (and its tie-in sets), or the fact that over the years Lego has only gotten exponentially more awesome. Perhaps I&#039;m just being guided naturally by the fact that no video games are really capturing my attention like they used to, or I&#039;m getting over my twinge of shame I have always felt at just wanting to play with a dumb toy all the time. The fact is that though other hobbies and interests have come and gone through my life, Lego has always been the constant - that secret guilty pleasure, maybe my only source of real happiness, that I&#039;m done trying to justify. Frankly it is high time we all stopped fighting our guilty pleasures. Why deny yourself the pleasure if you can just as easily simply deny yourself the guilt? There&#039;s nothing wrong with an adult enjoying a hobby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem any adult with a hobby faces, though, is figuring out just what direction to take that hobby. I have too much disposable income these days to limit my impulse purchases to a few sets at a time, and I&#039;m not quite rich enough to go ahead and buy everything. I love seeing the brand new stuff the Lego Group comes out with every few months, but I also feel like I owe it to Young Me to get my hands on some of those sets from the 90&#039;s that I looked at for hours in those old catalogues - or even the ones from the 80&#039;s that I don&#039;t even really know much about. I want to have my own massive basement world just like in <em>The Lego Movie</em> (honestly, who doesn&#039;t?), but I have no basement - massive or otherwise - in which to build it. My tastes are too varied and open to limit myself to just Pirates, or just Star Wars, or just any one kind of set. I&#039;m a sort who needs to feel like he&#039;s going somewhere with his toy purchases. I need a plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plenty of 'perfectly normal adults' collect Lego, as it happens. Some of those people are collectors who - like with any vintage toy, presumably - buy and sell unopened original sets from history. Today you can find Lego sets on EBay or elsewhere dating from all the way back to the &nbsp;50&#039;s when Lego was first a thing. Vintage collectors spend literally thousands of dollars on what amounts to old cardboard boxes that rattle when you shake them. These people are obviously wackos (although I will admit that they probably have an excellent track record of not losing pieces in the couch). Another type of collector is after minifigures, the little dudes that come with each set. You can find plenty of sets online for huge discounts - because someone bought them simply to add the dudes to their collection and ignore the rest. To me, Lego is about building stuff (and the emotional roller coaster that is searching for lost pieces). For me it isn&#039;t about ticking off checkboxes, so I don&#039;t think minifigure hunting is for me either. I am happy to take those figure-less sets off your hands, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lego doesn&#039;t have to just be about 'pure' collecting (not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it if that&#039;s your thing). Some Adult Fans of Lego (abbreviated AFOL by the online communities) could be called 'displayers' - people who buy all of the sets (or certain ones that pique their interests) so they can put it together once and put it out on a shelf to admire and appreciate. There are also builders, people who post ridiculously complicated custom builds on the Internet that make the rest of us feel inadequate and&nbsp;say <em>'how do you even have that many pieces?'</em> Ultimately, it seems as if there are as many motivations for collecting Lego bricks as there are Lego bricks. You might find these pieces in classrooms, board rooms, dorm rooms, bed rooms, work rooms, or probably a lot of other places that don&#039;t have the word &#039;room&#039; in their names. It&#039;s so versatile no matter what kind of hobby you&#039;re looking for, chances are you&#039;ll find something to enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is this versatility that really excites me about Lego, I think. When I was a kid, I had adventures with cursed mummies in Egypt, explored space, fought over deep-sea crystals or whatever, developed a Space Shuttle program, managed a busy commercial harbor, learned about engineering and mechanics, attacked (and defended) the Death Star, held numerous races, of both Formula One and Pod formats, build detailed working models of things, besieged castles, fought pirates, decorated my entire room (and sometimes house), fought robots, built robots, and planned entire cities - all with <em>the same toy</em>. Okay, okay, so technically those are all different iterations of the same toy system. When you get down to it, though, they all have the same parts, and as I said up at the beginning of all this rambling, all those parts are the same parts as the parts kids are playing with today. Sure, The Lego Group does introduce new ones all the time - as well as retire older ones. A lot of times, these are just new or old colors to support different themes. They&#039;re still the same basic pieces, and even if they aren&rsquo;t, they fit right in with everything that has come before. The instructions, too, are as open and universal as possible. Literally every single set of instructions from ever is available online for free (most of them through the Lego Group directly, others through a third party). Once you have the instructions, websites exist where you can find basically any Lego set ever made (or any individual pieces) being sold used (or even new) by collectors and retailers all over the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that means the Lego System is extremely easy to get into, and it&#039;s even easier to get deeper once you&#039;re in. I was looking through the online Lego databases at some of those old sets I used to pine away for (old habits die hard - even after almost two decades). Lego is Lego, so all those old sets have (pretty much) all of the same parts as these that I have scattered around me right now, and the instructions for them are literally a click away. I started thinking about dudes who, over the course of years, slowly assemble hand-made hot-rods or motorcycles in their garage. The pieces fit together so well. How many other sets or bulk pieces would you have to buy to be able to make any given set? How many sets could I make right now with what I have?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the point of all this rambling is that I do finally have the answer. I now not only have a clear and specific mission to pursue, but I even have a perfectly viable justification for pursuing it, as well as parallels to established 'adult' hobbies that should shut up even the most harsh critic (for example my own nagging requirements for a sense of purpose). It&#039;s cleaner (probably cheaper, too) than building a hot rod in my garage - and it doesn&#039;t even require a garage (or Tim Allen). It allows me to explore the history of my favorite and longest standing passion in life. It gives me a guideline to direct my otherwise random and impulsive usage of disposable income. All I have to do is pick a set, download the instructions, and get to work. Perhaps I had better get going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in conclusion, whether you&#039;re a collector, a designer, an engineer, or you just like to play, you have a home in Lego. In fact, even if you aren&#039;t one of those (you boring person, you), you can still probably find a reason to enjoy a Lego brick or two. I&#039;ve been playing with the things for twenty five years or something, and I&#039;m still discovering new ways to enjoy them. I can&#039;t wait to dive into the archives to start building some old-, and really old-school designs. I also can&#039;t wait to see next year&#039;s sets, and to pick up some of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> stuff (I have a certain thing for <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/post/372/Halloween_Costume_2011_The_Final_Chapter'>Groot</a>). After all this rambling, though, there&#039;s still a certain indefinable quality about Lego bricks. How can you describe the satisfaction of connecting two tiny interlocking plastic bits or the pure, blissful anticipation of something as simple as shaking a rattling box? Lego is just, well, awesome. What more can I say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep building, my friends - just make sure you check the couch and vacuum.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>In case you <a href='http://i.imgur.com/HVNBWD5.gif'>didn&#039;t read</a> my last post about Lego (don&#039;t worry, this one has pictures!), I&#039;m starting a new long-term project involving one of my absolute favoritest things (spoiler alert, it&#039;s Lego): Lego. My plan is to reach deep into the annals of time (why are you giggling?) and pick one of the old-school sets from my childhood that I&#039;ve always wanted to build. I&#039;m then going to slowly, perhaps over the course of years, put that set together. The first step in the process, of course, is picking which set I&#039;m going to be building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, picking a classic set was quick and there&#039;s no point belaboring it any further (but perhaps you&#039;ll allow me a bit of dramatic embellishment). Thinking back on all those catalogues I used to look at from the 90&#039;s, there was no theme I coveted more than <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Model-Team'>Model Team</a>. If you aren&#039;t familiar, basically once a year through the 90&#039;s, the Lego Group came out with a no-holds-barred, super detailed vehicle with no arbitrary scale or price constraints. They varied wildly in price, since there was apparently no specific guideline on how big they should be. Historically the price points for various themes and set sizes are pretty set-in-stone specific - you can be pretty sure that for any given theme you&#039;ll have a small <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/70400-1/Forest-Ambush'>set</a> or <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6918-1/Blacksmith-Attack'>two</a>, a <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/70401-1/Gold-Getaway'>couple</a> <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/70402-1/The-Gatehouse-Raid'>mediums</a>, and generally one <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/70404-1/King-s-Castle'>biggon&#039;</a> that would basically be all you got for Christmas that year. You couldn&#039;t really be certain about Model Team, though - they ranged from $40 all the way up to $140.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/modelteam.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The Model Team Logo in the 90&#039;s.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These were the cream of the crop. Back when a few bricks clumped around some wheels settled (albeit acceptably) for '<a href='http://brickset.com/sets/1702-1/Fire-Fighter-4-x-4'>car</a>' these were beautifully detailed, sophisticated, and expertly crafted models consisting of hundreds of pieces. No one 90&#039;s product line stands out more than Model Team, and no Model Team set comes close to the one that dominated the back page of the 1996 Lego Shop at Home Catalog. This set marked the climax for Model Team in both number of pieces and price, and it definitely marked a high point in Lego history. Some might even call it the most unabashedly <em>serious</em> Lego set of all time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m talking, of course, about <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5571-1/Giant-Truck'>5571: Giant Truck</a>. Even the name was right to the point. With 1742 very specific parts, it&#039;s probably going to take me quite a while to get it finished, the perfect choice for my hot-rod-in-the-garage project. Other sets might have come out that were <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Advanced-Models'>bigger</a>, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8258-1/Crane-Truck'>more complicated</a>, or <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/10179-1/Ultimate-Collector-s-Millennium-Falcon'>more detailed</a>. Other sets might have better, more <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/76023-1/The-Tumbler'>sophisticated</a> construction or have <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/4997-1/Transport-Ferry'>more features</a>. Other sets might even be built using nothing but parts I already own. However, no other set comes close to Giant Truck in my heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>So cool.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Giant Truck (also called 'The Black Cat') was introduced by The Lego Group (TLG) in 1996. I&#039;m pretty sure it was their attempt to see just what they could come up with given no restraint whatsoever. In the same year, TLG introduced some of the sets I most fondly remember playing with for years afterword - sets like <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6335-1/Indy-Transport'>6335: Indy Transport</a>, a set that saw countless hours of my attention, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6248-1/Volcano-Island'>6248: Volcano Island</a>, a set that I&#039;m literally looking at on my desk as I type this, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6331-1/Patriot-Jet'>6331: Patriot Jet</a>, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/1821-1/Rally-Racers'>1821: Rally Racers</a>, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8230-1/Coastal-Cop-Buggy'>8230: Coastal Copy Buggy</a>, and <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/1728-1/Crystal-Crawler'>1728: Crystal Crawler</a>, one of the best <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone'>Aquazone</a> sets. 1996 also saw the <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/subtheme-Exploriens'>Exploriens</a>, the key Lego space sub-theme from my childhood - <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6982-1/Explorien-Starship'>6982: Explorien Starship</a>, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6899-1/Nebula-Outpost'>6899: Nebula Outpost</a>, and <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6856-1/Planetary-Decoder'>6856: Planetary Decoder</a> saw a lot of adventures in my house. Also released in 1996, of course, was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_First_Contact'>Star Trek: First Contact</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64'>Super Mario 64</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D'>Duke Nukem 3D</a>, and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._James_Album'>Richard D. James Album</a>. The point is, it was a good year full of a lot of things I have spent a lot of hours with. However, I still stared at that catalog, dreaming of the one thing I knew I would never get.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/from-lego-1996-catalog.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is from the German catalog, but you get the point.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So first things first. The Lego group claims to host <a href='http://service.lego.com/en-us/buildinginstructions'>instructions</a> for over 3300 Lego models dating back to 2002. That definitely doesn&#039;t include Giant Truck by about six years, but I searched for it anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/found_one_product.PNG' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Oh, Lego, I love you.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Come on, though, they have to have Giant Truck. It&#039;s probably a matter of national pride in Denmark. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s on their flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/danish_flag.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I don&#039;t really remember what the Danish flag looks like, but that looks right.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, before I really dive in, we might as well humor the possibility of just buying this thing. There are several places where you can buy old Lego sets. The first, probably most obvious, option is <a href='http://www.ebay.com'>Ebay</a>. I pulled up a <a href='http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC2.A0.H0.Xlego+5571.TRS0&_nkw=lego+5571&_sacat=0'>quick search</a> and immediately saw a brand new, never opened Giant Truck for - brace yourself - <a href='http://i.imgur.com/T2gTaye.gif'>$1,325</a>. In case you&#039;re wondering what sort of investment an unopened Lego model can be, that&#039;s a <a href='http://i.imgur.com/j74SykU.gif'>946%</a> return on the $140 investment that set would have been if you bought it new. There&#039;s another brand new Giant Truck auction ending today with a current high bid of $890 - a relative steal! Obviously I&#039;m not going to be buying one of those.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/ebay-5571.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Presumably those 14 watchers are all like I was with that catalog back in &#039;96.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another source for old Lego stuff is called <a href='http://www.bricklink.com'>BrickLink</a>. It even sports a design from the 90&#039;s! Don&#039;t let the general shady appearance of the place fool you - it&#039;s a fantastic resource. I can confirm that to some extent. I have made exactly one purchase from somebody on BrickLink (that&#039;s a bit of a spoiler for later on). Some trepidation for BrickLink wouldn&#039;t be unjustified, I think, but considering just how long it&#039;s been around (since 2000) and how many buyers and sellers they have (312,353 registered users), I&#039;m guessing there are more good experiences than bad. You can certainly find any <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FA__4fLBos'>Lego or Lego accessory</a> you might be looking for there, being sold by one or more of the (as noted on the site) 8,563 different stores. It works like Ebay, sort of, acting simply as a broker between Lego sellers and Lego buyers. As a result, I imagine, the quality is more in the court of the specific people you deal with rather than BrickLink itself. There are extensive rating and problem handling tools, though, so like Ebay your reputation is on the line if you try to be a <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=knucklehead'>knucklehead</a>. Everybody there is united in a common love of all things Lego, though, so there&#039;s already a heightened sense of community.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-bricklink.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I can basically guarantee you&#039;ll find any set you might want there.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The cheapest Giant Truck <a href='http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?q=5571'>right now</a> is $341. That&#039;s if you want one used, without a box, and shipped from the United Kingdom, which probably won&#039;t be cheap (if you&#039;re a dumb American like me). The cheapest one in the US is $600. Basically we&#039;re still looking at a prohibitive expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last real source for used or old Lego would require that you happen to be lucky enough to have an independent used toy store in your neck of the woods - preferably one that deals specifically in Lego. I just so happen to be lucky enough to have had that happen. Out in the rich-people part of town is a store called <a href='http://bricksandminifigs.com/'>Bricks & Minifigs</a>. It&#039;s a great store, and it would be the greatest thing ever if the Internet didn&#039;t exist. Their prices are, if you&#039;re careful, decent (though you&#039;d only really buy new sets there if you&#039;re either insane or insanely rich), and they have an ever-changing assortment of used sets from various eras in their display case. It seems to be, for whatever reason, the place to go if you need one of several specific Star Wars sets that they always seem to have several of. It&#039;s not the place to go if you&#039;re looking for a very specific and extremely high-priced set from the 90&#039;s. They do have at least one brand new <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Advanced-Models'>10197: Fire Brigade</a>, one of the highest user-rated sets out there, which was discontinued a while ago. It&#039;s pretty <a href='http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?pg=1&q=10197&invNew=N&itemType=S&viewFrom=sf&sz=10&searchSort=P'>expensive</a>, as you might imagine. They don&#039;t, however, have Giant Truck, so don&#039;t even ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/bricks-n-minifigs.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I&#039;m very lucky to have this resource nearby. I&#039;m sorry that I took this with my phone.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Bricks and Minifigs does - in addition to making grammar awkward - have three huge bins of random parts that you can buy by the bucket- or bag-full. This might come in handy later if I need any specific, but not terribly rare, parts. I think it&#039;s safe to say I will be needing some parts at some point in this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-stickers.PNG' />\r\n<div class='caption'>And stickers, I guess. I&#039;m just going to not worry about that right now.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So then the question becomes one of logistics. What ground rules, if any, should I set down for how I acquire those parts that I don&#039;t yet have? I could be strict about where they come from - specifying that they have to be from a certain vintage or that I have to get them all out of actual sets. However, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m going to be that hard on myself. Just a cursory bit of checking parts lists online shows that Giant Truck needs like twenty of several parts that only appear at most in quantities of four in other sets. I&#039;m <a href='http://i.imgur.com/QgFzD8m.gif'>not</a> about to buy five copies of a Lego set from the 90&#039;s for a hundred bucks a pop just to have enough of, for example, these guys:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/609126.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Officially: 609126 Brick 1 x 2 x 11/3 with Curved Top (Black)</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s clear then that Giant Truck is not even close to the ideal set for showcasing how easily you could make a particular set using parts out of a bunch of other ones. What Giant Truck might be perfect for, however, is trying out as many sources for parts as I can. Perhaps that will be the central thesis of this whole thing (other than 'Giant Truck is awesome'). What method for sourcing particular pieces is the most fun, or the easiest, or the cheapest? I&#039;ll look for parts in my own collection, by buying both used and new sets, in those bulk bins at that store I&#039;m super lucky to have in my town, ordering them online, or even digging through the vacuum - I&#039;ll leave no stone unturned in my quest for all 1,742 pieces of the Black Cat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my next article / post / essay / whatever this is, I&#039;ll actually show some Lego pieces being put together. In the meantime, keep on building - and if you happen to find any of those curved brick dudes shown above in your vacuum, maybe drop me a line.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>To recap, I&#039;m working on a new long-term project featuring one of my all time most favorite things, Lego. I have gone back to my childhood and picked out an epic, monumental Lego set that I&#039;ve always wanted to build - 1996&#039;s <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5571-1/Giant-Truck'>5571: Giant Truck</a>. I&#039;m going to slowly, perhaps over the course of years, put that set together. I found instructions for the set and ruled out the possibility of buying it (since it&#039;s crazy expensive in the used toy market). Now it&#039;s time to crack open those instructions and actually get started. Well, the instructions are a digital PDF on my computer, so we&#039;ll be doing whatever the digital version of cracking is - double clicking, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They just don&#039;t make instructions like they did back in 1996. That&#039;s purely a statement of fact, you can make your own assumptions about which is 'better.' The PDF containing Giant Truck&#039;s instructions is 107 pages long. Only 60 of those cover the construction of Giant Truck. The other 47 pages cover the alternate model, some sort of Also-Giant-But-Not-As-Giant Truck. Compare that to a modern 'spare no expense' set, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/71006-1/The-Simpsons-House'>71006: The Simpsons&#039; House</a>, which has about 800 more pieces than Giant Truck. The Simpsons&#039; House has 237 pages of instructions spanning three booklets (and no alternate model). That&#039;s five times the instructions for a set that has only 1.4 times the parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/71006-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I purchased this set right after I had some wisdom teeth removed. I mean right after - on the ride home. Oddly enough, I don&#039;t exactly remember doing that. </div>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously you should take that statistic with a grain of salt (and keep your weird salt-eating habits away from me, weirdo). The Simpsons&#039; House is a very different kind of set than Giant Truck, so they maybe shouldn&#039;t be compared to each other. I&#039;m no <a href='http://simpsonswiki.com/w/images/thumb/4/4a/Mathemagician.png/250px-Mathemagician.png'>mathemagician</a>, so I don&#039;t know how to make numbers prove my points, but I&#039;m pretty sure comparing two things that are only casually related is not the best argument. It&#039;s undeniable, though, that times have changed. The average number of parts in an instruction step has gone way down. If I were some sort of mathman I would be able to quantify this in a meaningful way, but you&#039;ll just have to rely on my crazy old man 'I swear it sure seems like it' claims. Perhaps you&#039;ll get an idea of what I&#039;m talking about as we move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/simpsons-inst-55.PNG' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Compare this random (but average) page from the Simpsons&#039; House to some of the steps we&#039;ll encounter for Giant Truck.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said in the last post, I&#039;m not going to plan ahead and try to gather resources before getting started. I&#039;m going to save time by just diving in and seeing how far I can get with what I already have in the Ol&#039; Archive. Obviously this is paying off, as I am now over two entire posts into this project and nothing has been built yet. All that is about to change, however. Let&#039;s go for it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-step-1.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This is the first page of Giant Truck&#039;s instructions, including the first three steps, and the customary axle sizing guide.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, I am going to have just one more quick digression before going for it. I want to point out that little thumbnail that always shows up at the start of any Lego instructions of the set you&#039;re building (you can see it on the page posted just above). They do this because sometimes the instructions break out and build certain separate components and this shows exactly what we&#039;re doing right now. They still have those thumbnails in instructions today (for example, in The Simpsons&#039; House there&#039;s a set of instructions for the Simpsons&#039; famous pink car, the garage, and then various sections of the house, and each of those sections has a little thumbnail preceding them). I wonder if they should do this for other things. Maybe if they put little pictures of you as a healthy, happy adult on packages of vegetables, kids would be more into them. A picture at the start of high school of me showing my report card to my parents and having them not be mad at me probably would have motivated me a bit more in class. I mean, it wouldn&#039;t hurt. Anyway, it just feels a little bit silly for Giant Truck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Instructions for Giant Truck: Chapter One: Giant Truck. In this set of instructions we will be building Giant Truck.</em> Good to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, the first step requires four pieces. The two <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3460'>1x8</a> and one <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3795'>2x6</a> black plates are no problem. <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/2719'>The 1x10 Technic Plate with Toothed Ends</a>, however . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great, it&#039;s the first step and I&#039;m already stuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digging through the Ol&#039; Archive, I found that I have (at least) eight <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/4262'>1x6</a> versions of that technic plate, and at least one <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/4442'>1x8</a>. Cue the first actual picture of Lego pieces that I took (finally):</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-beams.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>In Grey <em>and</em> Black. I don&#039;t know what that 1x8 plate is doing in this picture.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Rebrickable, part 2719: <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/2719'>Technic Plate 1x10 with Toothed Ends</a> was in 23 sets in grey including Giant Truck (it&#039;s also in one set in black, and another set in light bluish gray). I have exactly none of those sets in the Ol&#039; Archive. This shall be the first piece I have to hunt for, I guess. In the meantime, I have a couple of part 2711: <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/2711'>1x5 Technic Plate with Toothed Ends, 2 Studs and Center Axle Hole</a> (it just rolls off the tongue), which can be put side-by-side to make the plate I need. They&#039;re black instead of grey, but they&#039;ll at least make do until I can find the proper piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step1complete.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>I always like when the first step of these old-school sets was basically just 'take these pieces and put them generally near each other.'</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step one complete!</strong>\r\n<br /><em>How much did I have?</em> 75%\r\n<br /><em>How much did I improvise?</em> 25%\r\n<br /><em>Does it look like a truck yet?</em> Heavens no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-step-2.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here it is again, in case you forgot.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Each step of the Giant Truck instructions includes a handy little box showing exactly what parts the step requires. This information is incredibly useful, and (pretty much) all Lego instructions today have these boxes on each step. However, this wasn&#039;t always the case. Giant Truck, being obviously the King of Lego was given the honor of these info boxes; other 'expert' sets over the years that weren&#039;t specifically labeled with the Technic badge were also bestowed the honor. Regular sets in the 90&#039;s, however, were not deemed worthy. This often (for me, at least) led to moments where you would notice pieces in the instructions and realize that they were supposed to be added several pages ago - or you would end up with pieces at the end of it all with no idea where or when they were supposed to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5976-page14.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Page 14 of 1999&#039;s <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5976-1/River-Expedition'>5976: River Expedition</a>, containing steps 19 and 20. Can you spot all the differences between these pictures?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern sets owe those part info panels to the <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Technic'>Technic</a> line. Instructions for Technic sets included the panels all the way back to the <a href='http://www.peeron.com/scans/850-1'>70&#039;s</a> when Technic was first a thing. They slowly trickled down to all of the instructions around <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/year-2000'>2000</a> (aught-aught) and <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/year-2001'>2001</a> (aught-one), at which point most of the 'regular' set instructions have them. Quickly perusing instructions online, I found <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8404-1/Public-Transport-Station'>sets</a> lacking the info panels even into 2010 (aught-ten), but I&#039;m pretty sure those are the exception. Even the cheapest sets today have them. It only makes sense to have that info across the board, and I&#039;m definitely glad the Lego Group listened to 10 year-old me when I was the first person to have that idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/60018-step6.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here&#039;s Step 6 (the entirety of page 10) for <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/60018-1/Cement-Mixer'>60018: Cement Mixer</a>, from 2013 (a fantastic little set). Here you see just how comically basic the instructions can be these days.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So Giant Truck Step 2 requires one <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3010'>1x4</a> red brick and two <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3622'>1x3</a> red bricks. That isn&#039;t a problem at all. I even have the right colors and I think they&#039;re vintage pieces, so that&#039;s a bonus. Hot rod dudes are always looking for the same model year parts, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step2complete.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>So far the improvised piece is working great.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step two complete!</strong>\r\n<br /><em>How much did I have?</em> 100%!\r\n<br /><em>Does it look like a truck yet?</em> Still definitely no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-step-3.PNG' />\r\n<div class='caption'>It looks like Giant Truck is going to rely heavily on those grey <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/4274'>technic half pin</a> pieces (or as Brickset more awesome-ly calls them, '<a href='http://brickset.com/parts/427402'>Connector Peg with Knob</a>') to attach details to later on.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the fun begins. I was worried about these super long Technic beams, since they aren&#039;t at all as common anymore as they used to be. However, digging into the Ol&#039; Archives revealed that I have <em>several</em>. Additionally, what Lego piece collection is complete without about ten thousand of those 'Peg with Knob' pieces? My collection has plenty of them at any rate - they will not be a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step3parts.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Here are the parts for step 3. So far I have learned that I need a better way to photograph Lego pieces besides just putting them on my filthy, poorly-lit desk.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3703'>1x16 Technic Brick with Holes</a> - check. 1x6 plate - no problem. Peg knobs, I&#039;ve got plenty of those. I&#039;m rocking and rolling now (well, I&#039;m not rolling, the wheels don&#039;t get added for quite some time.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Rebrickable, the 1x16 Technic brick with holes has 584 instances in 150 sets, going all the way back to 1980. Mine probably came from 1998&#039;s <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/3038-1/Super-Challenge'>3038: Super Challenge</a>. That set is noteworthy for being an indicator (perhaps harbinger) of the future of Technic, since it relies heavily on the <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/32278'>studless beams</a> that have (pretty much) completely replaced their studded counterparts in the aught-aughts and aught-aughteens. Thankfully Super Challenge had a couple 1x16&#039;s of the studded variety for me to utilize on Giant Truck 16 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step3problem.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The improvised beam is causing a potential problem, now. These stand-ins are missing a stud, so this will reduce the structural strength of the truck ever-so-slightly. We&#039;ll see if this proves to be a problem.</div>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step3complete.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Three steps in and there&#039;s no serious problem yet.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step three complete!</strong>\r\n<br /><em>How much did I have?</em> 100%\r\n<br /><em>Does it look like a truck yet?</em> No, but it is one piece at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/5571-step-4.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This caption is about as boring as step 4 is.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We finish up today with what is basically a rehash of step 3. No 1x6 plate this time around, however. In the end, step 4 is a predictable romp with the same old plot points and no surprises. I predict a poor showing at the box office this fall. Wait, what were we talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/prog-step4complete.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Yeah, I had the front assembly a bit too far forward in the last step. I&#039;ve fixed it, so don&#039;t worry.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step four complete!</strong>\r\n<br /><em>How much did I have?</em> 100%\r\n<br /><em>Does it look like a truck?</em> Yes - er, wait - no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ll leave it there for now. The Giant Truck is <strong>7.7% complete</strong>. After four steps we are left with something that is neither giant nor truck, but it&#039;s . . . well, it clearly has a long way to go, but progress is, as they say, progress (does anybody say that?). Perhaps it&#039;s just nostalgia, but building something from digital instructions loses something from the more tangible counterpart. There&#039;s a certain magic about turning the page and seeing what&#039;s to come, and judging how cool a set is by how thick the book is (which could explain why the instructions are so much longer lately). Indeed, Lego instructions, digital or not, have come a long way in the last twenty-aught years or so. Are we, though, as Lego fans living in the future, any better or worse off than they, the Lego fans living in the past, were in ninety-whatever? It&#039;s difficult to determine without some more sophisticated maths (and without letting those pesky opinions cloud the issue). One thing is easy to quantify, though: <a href='http://rebrickable.com/stats/sets'>3,755 sets</a> have come out since the nineties that those poor shlubs never had. I&#039;d say that makes us the winners, better instructions or not. So until next time, you lucky Lego fans of the future, keep on building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feel free to let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions, too. <em>For the sake of full disclosure: stats, part names, set lists, and other data points were taken from <a href='http://www.brickset.com'>Brickset</a> and / or <a href='http://www.rebrickable.com'>Rebrickable</a>.

      "text": "<p>To recap, I have embarked on a new long-term project involving something very awesome to me, Lego. I have gone back to my childhood and picked out an epic, monumental Lego set that I&#039;ve always wanted to build - 1996&#039;s 5571: Giant Truck. I&#039;m going to slowly, perhaps over the course of years, put that set together. I dove right into the instructions (after a lot of rambling) and was able to get the first four steps completed with what I had laying around in the Ol&#039; Archives, only having to improvise once to fashion a piece I didn&#039;t have out of two smaller ones I did. With any luck, Giant Truck will mostly require more common parts - that is, ones that I actually have. Of all the 1,742 parts in Giant Truck, which is the most common, I wonder? What about in all of the Lego world? What is the Champion Part?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/4100457.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>This isn&#039;t it, but a crown seemed appropriate or something.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the most common Lego piece kind of depends on how you want to judge it (and what numbers you can trust). Basically there are two ranking systems. You can rank pieces by how many times they&#039;ve been used in total, in which case multiple instances in a single set will improve a piece&#039;s ranking, or you can  rank them purely by how many sets they&#039;ve appeared in, quantities notwithstanding. Both stats have their merits, but I tend to think of the second one as being a bit more universal. Some sets might take advantage of a whole bunch of one piece or another, but in my opinion the Champion Part is the one that has been used in the most sets. I think that shows more usefulness or versatility - or maybe just the part that&#039;s the simplest. Rebrickable shows both ranks, and I think their numbers are reasonably trustworthy, so I&#039;ll blatantly copy and paste both stats here to make it look like I actually did research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s get back to the Giant Truck, already in progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/5571-step-5.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The parts count for each step is starting to go up.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to be able to know the origin of every piece I put into Giant Truck, but for some it seems a little <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sor0LXiSZg'>un-possible</a>. This step contains some super common parts that could have come from anywhere. A lot of these parts have been around since the Beginning, or at least as near as makes no difference. They&#039;ve appeared in hundreds - in fact thousands, of sets over the last fifty-or-whatever years. Let&#039;s just take each piece in this step one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/302026.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>First up: this one.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2x4 Plate, or Part <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3020'>3020</a> as his friends call him, is definitely one of those super common parts. This is one of THE Lego pieces - one of the ones everybody has, even if they don&#039;t collect Lego sets. It appears almost 20,000 times in over 3,400 different sets and 40 different colors. That makes it the 11th most common part overall, and the second most common part included in a set. It&#039;s safe to say that I own at least one of the 1,048 sets that had a 2x4 Plate in black (element ID 302026). This particular one I&#039;m using could have been from quite a few of those. I would list the ones I have, but it&#039;s too numerous for how lazy I feel right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be a bit easier, however, to track down where my 2x6 Plate (Part ID <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3795'>3795</a>) might be from. I was somewhat surprised to see that the 2x6 plate is actually pretty common, at 28th overall and ninth by set use, appearing almost 10,000 times in just over 2,400 different sets in 36 colors since its introduction in 1978. The color I need (specifically 'Light Gray', Element ID 379502) was one of the original colors for the 2x6 plates and has appeared 511 times in 240 sets since 1978 - more than I expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/2x6-light-grey-sets.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Specifically these sets.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The odds are actually semi-decent that mine came from <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/1821-1/Rally-Racers'>1821</a>: Rally Racers, from 1996, which would make this one of those sweet, sweet same-model-year parts. Rally Racers is a fitting set to get parts from because it contains a pair of trucks, so these parts already have some truck experience. For the record, Rally Racers also includes a black 2x4 Plate. That&#039;s quite a useful little set, there.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/1821-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Keep racing, fellas, at least until I dismantle you for all your plates.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1x3 Brick (Part ID <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3622'>3622</a>, in black 362226) is a bit more uncommon. Like the 2x6 plate this piece was first seen in 1978, but in fewer colors. Today it ranks in at 20 overall and 31 by set use. Of course, that&#039;s out of like 17,000 parts, so it&#039;s still quite common. In Black the piece has appeared so far in 365 sets (you could build one a day for an entire year!), so that actually makes that particular color more common than the 2x6 Plate in Gray that I just dug up. Also, since black is a color the Lego Group still produces, this is a part that has appeared in sets all the way into 2014 and (probably) beyond (for example there are a modest 32 of them in <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/10237-1'>10237</a>: Tower of Orthanc from 2013). I could very well have pried this one out of <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6048-1'>6048</a>: Majisto&#039;s Magical Workshop, a beautiful little set from 1993. I think Majisto&#039;s Workshop was my sister&#039;s when we were kids and as a result I wasn&#039;t allowed to touch, look at, play with, or think about it, but I have it now so who gets the last laugh?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/suckitaili.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Look eight-year-old me, I totally won! Take that, twelve-year-old my sister!</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&#039;s the most common piece to appear in a set? This is apropos trivia, since the part is in fact included in this step of Giant Truck. It&#039;s the Inverted 2x4 Double Slope. Just kidding - it&#039;s the <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3023'>1x2 Plate</a>, which has appeared no fewer than 45,500 times in almost 4,000 sets. It&#039;s the second most common part overall, because there is one other part that appears in higher quantities, but at least according to Rebrickable (or at least according to my interpretation of the numbers on Rebrickable that don&#039;t really have any explanation), no part has appeared in more sets than the good old 1x2. I need a yellow one in this step, which is one of the less common colors, appearing in 629 sets (the black 1x2 has appeared in 1,315). This one could have come from <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8828-1'>8828</a>: Front End Loader, a set I somehow had two of as a kid. A yellow 1x2 plate is also in <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6335-1'>6335</a>: Indy Transport (&#039;96 - same model year), but since my one of those is still at Mom and Dad&#039;s house, I don&#039;t think this one came from there. This piece totally tore it up in 2014, actually, appearing in almost 40 different sets (just in yellow), so it&#039;s still super easy to get your hands on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/302326.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The most common Lego piece to appear in a set.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the part that&#039;s number one overall? This is less apropos, because none of them appear in this particular step (but they will come up in Giant Truck eventually, I&#039;m sure). Interestingly, it seems to be the <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3004'>1x2 brick</a>, which has been made in 52 colors since 1959. It just edges out the plate version by appearing 62,633 times (give or take), but falls short of both the 1x2 plate and the 2x4 plate by only appearing in 3,338 sets. Apparently the 1x2 shape is the most useful of all the Lego piece sizes. If this step had called for one of these 1x2 bricks, this could possibly be the easiest step of Giant Truck. Since it isn&#039;t in this step, though, I can&#039;t really justify bringing it up right now, so just forget I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/300426.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Not really relevant to what we&#039;re doing.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This step also calls for a couple 1x2 Tiles, which is also a pretty common part. These studless wonders have appeared over 15,000 times in almost 2,000 sets, ranking it 15th overall and 17th by set. The use of this piece is boosted, of course, by the number of different printed versions that exist. This versatile part has been used for keyboards, equipment panels, bus tickets, license plates (for example '<a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3069bpb288'>OUTATIME</a>'), other random text, dashboards, cash, envelopes, the word 'POLICE,' and tons of other things. I need a couple blue ones for Giant Truck, and I was able to find them pretty easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1x2 tile has come in 50 different colors, including Blue, Medium Blue, Sky Blue, Dark Blue, Maersk Blue, Sand Blue, Trans-Dark Blue, and Trans-Light Blue. I&#039;m pretty sure the ones I dug up are the regular blue that I require. It looks like the Blue 1x2 Tile first appeared in 1992 with <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6038-1'>6038</a>: Wolfpack Renegades. I don&#039;t have that set, but I do have <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/7553-1'>7553</a>: City Advent Calendar (2011), which had one, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/71006-1'>71006</a>: The Simpsons&#039; House (2014), which has eight, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5988-1'>5988</a>: The Temple of Anubis (1998), which has one, and <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6331-1'>6331</a>: Patriot Jet (1996), which has nine. One of these that I&#039;m using might be from the Advent Calendar (I bet you never thought about Advent Calendars as a source for parts!), but I can be pretty sure at least one of these is from the same-model-year Patriot Jet (the Simpsons&#039; house is stored in a separate container, and the Temple of Anubis is two hours away at my Mom and Dad&#039;s house, so it can&#039;t be from those). I&#039;ll look into colors more in a future post.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/306923.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>A very difficult piece to visualize.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To be extra, pedantically clear, this 1x2 Tile is specifically <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3069b'>3069b</a>: Tile 1x2 with Groove, which first appeared in 1974. There&#039;s a tiny, well, groove around the bottom of all of the tile pieces, which gives you just a bit of purchase for pulling them apart (or for wedging that remover tool in there), since there aren&#039;t any studs up top to use for leverage. Indeed, without that simple tiny groove, these would be sucky to remove (but easier to write rhyming couplets about). There was a Tile 1x2 Without Groove (<a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/3069a'>3069a</a>), which appeared in the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s, while also appearing for some reason in a few sets in the early aught-tens. For the record, the non-grooved 1x2 tile is ranked 309 overall and 868 by set, which isn&#039;t too shabby for a piece that (for the most part) hasn&#039;t been produced in 35 years. Giant Truck will not be using any Tile 1x2 Without Groove, so you can forget I mentioned that one, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the other pieces in this step, the black Inverted 45 degree 2x4 Double Slope took a bit of digging, but I do have one. By my reckoning, this one also came from <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6331-1'>6331</a> Patriot Jet, which is proving to be another pretty good source for parts along with those racin&#039; trucks. The double slope (part number <a href='http://rebrickable.com/parts/4871'>4871</a>, if you&#039;re curious) has been used 652 times in 352 sets since being introduced in 1985. It comes in 14 colors, but first appeared in Light Gray in <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6377-1/Delivery-Center'>6377</a>: Delivery Center. The black one (which started its career in &#039;87 as a <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/6954-1/Renegade'>spaceship part</a>) is in 76 sets, including at least one Advent Calendar (not the one I have) and a couple sets that came out this year (2014). It&#039;s one of those old standbys that&#039;s always been around (to me that&#039;s literal, since it was first produced the year before I was born).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So anyway, all this is to say that I have all of the parts for this step.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/step5-ready.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Sheesh, why didn&#039;t I just say that?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The little rear assembly in this step is, perhaps, the first visual embellishment of the Truck so far. We&#039;ll be able to see how that sloped piece will look as more Giant Truck gets built around it, but it might be our first glimpse of the Giant attention to detail in this set. It&#039;s also interesting that the 1x2 piece inside there is yellow, considering we may never see it in the final product. I always wonder if designers put bright colors in places you&#039;ll never see them like that just for the heck of it, or if they were trying to meet certain color quotas. Perhaps we&#039;ll never know.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/4/step5-assembled.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>The truck is starting to take shape. It still isn&#039;t a truck shape, but it&#039;s some sort of shape.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Step five complete:<br />\r\nHow many parts were needed? 8!<br />\r\nHow much did I have? 100%<br />\r\nDoes it look like a truck yet? Nope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy, if I can continue to ramble on this much I ought to be able to eek this project out for the rest of my life. The only problem with doing that, aside from the fact that nobody in their right minds would read that much inane information, is that all of the statistics I&#039;m posting in these earlier posts will probably be completely obsolete and incorrect by the time this is all said and done. The Lego world is an ever changing one, and with new sets introduced basically every couple weeks, there are new sources for parts, both common and rare. Who knows, maybe in a few months we&#039;ll have a new set with a whole bunch of some part that drives it up to the top of the charts, or we&#039;ll see some huge paradigm shift that will dethrone the current 1x2 champ. One of the things I love about this world is that like the very creations we can build with them, the parts themselves are ever changing. However, sets that will come out next year will still contain parts I could use in this set from 1996. That 1x2 plate is the champ because it&#039;s the same piece (at least as far as we need to concern ourselves) that they&#039;ve been making for 50 years. This world, then, is as dynamic and fluid as you want it to be. That&#039;s pretty awesome. What&#039;s your champion part - that part you find most useful or important? What piece do you have the most of in your collection? Whether you&#039;re going to go count out your pieces or not, keep on building, my friends. I&#039;ll see you all next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s worth noting (again) that all of the statistics shown here were taken from Rebrickable and are accurate only inasmuch as that site is accurate. The numbers are almost constantly going up (as new sets are released or catalogued on Rebrickable&#039;s database), so the numbers listed here will not be accurate for long. Still, it&#039;s a reasonable representation of part rankings and history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, remember to let me know if you like these posts or if there&#039;s anything you&#039;d like me to elaborate on in the future (as if I&#039;m not already elaborating far too much).</p>",

      "text": "<p>In case you haven&#039;t seen my website in a while - or you haven&#039;t spoken to me at all - I&#039;ve been working on a new project involving one of my favoritest things, Lego. I&#039;m working on building a particular Lego set that I thought was super cool when I was a kid. The 1,742 piece epic that is Lego Model <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5571-1/Giant-Truck' target='_blank'>5571: Giant Truck</a>, from 1996, was always my favorite page of the Lego Shop at Home Catalog, and now I&#039;m going to build my very own. I found the instructions online, and through the power of having a lot of Lego bricks laying around, I am hopeful that I can make it happen. Only time will tell how far I will be able to get before I hit the inevitable roadblock of 'I just don&#039;t have one of those.' As the steps have worn on and I have been tasked with less common parts, time has begun to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHqa6q-IReY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this video for my latest update, or read below if you prefer reading to watching. Yes, I realize that it took me way too long to post this. While getting Giant truck together, I am also working on getting my life together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, my last post completed step six, so now I&#039;m ready for step 7, and I&#039;m nervously awaiting the time when I hit an Inevitable Roadblock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/5571-step-7.png' />\r\n\r\n<p>I have hit an Inevitable Roadblock. Now I need two more of those <a href='http://www.rebrickable.com/parts/2719' target='_blank'>8x1 Technic plate with toothed end mounts</a>. I definitely knew that this was coming when the first one of these came up back in step three or whatever, because these Technic plates never travel alone. I have the other parts for this step, but not those Technic plates. This will be the first case where I&#039;ll just have to halt progress until I get them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do I do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said in the earlier post about step three or whatever, these parts are featured in 23 sets, so I could look around for one of those. Let&#039;s hit up Bricklink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coolest set (aside from Giant Truck, obviously) that these parts are in would probably be <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8868' target='_blank'>8868: Air Tech Claw Rig</a>, from 1992 (four years before Giant Truck). It&#039;s a super sweet truck with a big crane on the back - or some sort of weird car with a grabber thing on the front (or a lot of other things I guess, if you&#039;re good at building things with Lego). It originally went for $139.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/8868-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>8868: Air Tech Claw Rig. It&#039;s even fun to say.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Lego is pretty serious about cranes as it turns out; 8868 was neither the first nor the last. In fact, just in &#039;012 they made what is basically a remake of the Airtech Claw Rig, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/9397' target='_blank'>9397: Logging Truck</a>, which had a retail price of - look at that - $139 (the newer one has more pieces, too). Those of you saying Lego has gotten more expensive can go ahead and eat your hats now, or whatever. The modern 9397 is Hell of more awesome in a literal sense (8868 is arguably more awesome in a uselessly nostalgic 'back in my day' sense).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/9397-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>One of many logging trucks made by the Lego Group. Just why do they hate trees so much?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Claw Rig is going for a minimum of $105 on Bricklink. At this point in my life (which was several months ago, since these posts take so long for me to make), I had never bought anything on Bricklink before. I wasn&#039;t sure how shipping worked, and the cheapest options were all in Europe. I was pretty worried about that. Through the power of hindsight, I now know that it&#039;s prohibitively expensive to ship any Lego sets from overseas. Anyway, Claw Rig has five - count &#039;em - five of those 8x1 plates-with-whatevers I&#039;ll need, giving me a pretty inefficient surplus of two. However, there&#039;s a good chance I&#039;ll be able to use quite a few other parts from Claw Rig in Giant Truck. Also - I should point out - if I buy a Claw Rig I&#039;ll also then have a super sweet Claw Rig that I can play with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m 29, why do you ask?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s another truck-with-crane option, <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8854' target='_blank'>8854: Power Crane</a>. This one&#039;s from 1989 and it&#039;s just a little too funny looking for me. This does show just how awesome those pneumatic functions were, considering this set from &#039;89 has very similar pumps and actuators to the ones you can find on sets today. Power Crane is priced in the 70&#039;s on BrickLink (from the Netherlands). It has exactly three of the little plates I need, so there&#039;s no unnecessary redundancy. However, the extensive red-ness of Power Crane leaves little room, I think, for other parts I could use, and I wouldn&#039;t have that super sweet Claw Rig, so I think I&#039;ll pass on this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/8854-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>8854: Power Crane, with a face only a mother could love. A mother crane.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet another crane option (there isn&#039;t really anything more Lego than a crane, I guess - except for maybe a <a href='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/ferries.png' target='_blank'>ferry</a>) is <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8438' target='_blank'>8438: Pneumatic Crane Truck</a>, from 2003. It&#039;s a re-release of <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8431' target='_blank'>8431</a> (from 2002), which was a re-release of <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8460' target='_blank'>8460</a> (from 1995). The early 2000&#039;s were a really weird time for Lego. Still, since this wasn&#039;t actually made in the early 2000&#039;s, it&#039;s a cool set. It&#039;s a bit less truck than Air Tech Claw Rig, but a bit more crane. Like Claw Rig and Power Crane, Pneumatic Crane Truck takes advantage of the titular Pneumatic functionality to operate, just like a real crane! Since it&#039;s smaller than Claw Rig, it&#039;s a bit cheaper. It was originally $85, and you can find them on BrickLink for - as of whenever I looked it up - $73 (from the Netherlands, so that isn&#039;t really a number that applies to me at all).  I really like the look of Pneumatic Crane Truck, and when I put myself into the shoes of younger me (or current-age me, for that matter), it&#039;s a tough choice between it and Claw Rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/8438-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>8438: Pneumatic Crane Truck - surprisingly hard to say.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The real vintage choice is <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8054' target='_blank'>8054: Universal Motor Set</a>, from 1989. I guess this is the same amount of vintage as Power Crane, but this one feels more vintage to me. They don&#039;t make these 'here are some bits, and some things you can do with aforesaid bits' sets anymore in the Technic label, and I think that&#039;s a shame. A lot of things can be learned about Engineering tinkering with one of these, but God forbid we give kids a chance to not know what they&#039;re doing, they might make a mistake. Anyway, Universal Motor Set has a crane and a car and another car and a helicopter, plus whatever else you feel like making with a motor in it. This also has a super old-school motor kit which some collectors might be all 'oh baby' over. I&#039;m not super keen on the motor, though, since it isn&#039;t in Giant Truck. Universal Motor Set is going for as little as $39 ($45 from somebody in the US).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/8054-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>8054: Universal motor set. It&#039;s universal as long as you are building a crane.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another, much cheaper, option is <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8829' target='_blank'>8829: Dune Blaster</a>. I had a very similar vehicle to Dune Blaster (<a href='http://brickset.com/sets/8320' target='_blank'>8320: Coastal Cop Buggy</a>, from two years later) - but mine doesn&#039;t have the parts I need. Dune Blaster is a pretty straightforward buggy that also makes a motorcycle. It has suspension and a moving engine, which is kind of neat I guess. Dune Blaster is going for as little as $17 (from the US) on BrickLink, which is also kind of neat.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/8829-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>8829: Dune Blaster: because dunes don&#039;t blast themselves!</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#039;re a cheapotron, though, the best choice might be <a href='http://brickset.com/sets/5279' target='_blank'>5279: Steering Elements, Plates and Gear Racks</a>. This was just a little sack of bits that you could get to make your Legos able to steer, I guess. Like I said before, the rack and pinion setup was Hell of common in sets back in 'the day' so I really don&#039;t know why you would want to get one of these, since these parts were everywhere at the time. Well, I guess maybe you&#039;re trying to build Giant Truck and need one of those sweet, sweet 8x1 jobs. It just happens that this sack of bits comes with three of them, so that&#039;s handy. It&#039;s $5 (from Germany) on BrickLink, so that&#039;s pretty handy, too - unless shipping ends up being more than the sack itself. For the money, SE, PaGR offers the smallest barrier to having the parts I need.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/Lego/post 6/5279-1.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>5279: Steering Elements, Plates and Gear Racks. 1993&#039;s nominee for COOLEST NAME EVER.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#039;re an Omega Cheapotron you might say 'just buy three of those parts, dummy.' Well, BrickLink does have a massive (perhaps even Giant) repository of parts for sale from all over the world. I can get those 8x1 plates for as little as $0.07 a piece (that&#039;s seven cents). Most places have a minimum total you have to meet with your order, but I&#039;m sure I could get there just by flipping a few pages ahead in Giant Truck&#039;s instructions to find a few more parts I need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something just feels a little cheap (-otron) about just buying parts, though. It is staying true to the 'building a hot rod in my garage' aesthetic that I&#039;m going for I guess. I can just order all the parts I&#039;ll need and get this thing done and then I&#039;ll have that Giant Truck I always wanted. However, this endeavor will lose the 'look at how universal Legos are' aesthetic that I was hoping to show off, too. There&#039;s something really fascinating about building this big (perhaps even Giant) truck purely from parts scavenged from other sets. Also this whole project may or may not just be an excuse to buy all of the old sets I lusted after but could never get because I was just a Poor Child. Now that I&#039;m a Rich Child I can do all the things I always wanted to do (which is pretty much exclusively buying Legos). On the other hand, is buying some old sets any different than buying old parts, when you get down to it, other than how much more expensive it will ultimately be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess it comes down to what my goal here really is. If this truly is a hot-rod-in-the-garage project, I&#039;d just order the parts I need and get her done, as it were. However, that is a super sweet claw rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spoiler alert: I ordered the Claw Rig.</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "<p>My name is Shauvon McGill and I will be your guide through the land of nonsense. Now, I understand that calling it nonsense probably doesn&rsquo;t set it (or me, for that matter) up as a terribly respectable or in fact useful subject. However, just bear with me here, because in my professional opinion, the whole concept of nonsense does not get the respect it deserves. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; You might say to me. &ldquo;Yes, exactly,&rdquo; I reply. Then you will probably walk away because that&rsquo;s not a great way for me to retain an audience. I promise that over the next weeks, months, and perhaps years if Kate will keep me around that long, I will show you a thing or two that just might - dare I say it - change the world! I&rsquo;ll also occasionally tell some jokes, so you might at least have a good time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonsense, malarky, &ldquo;hoo-haw&rdquo; - whatever you call it, you can&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s actually kind of everywhere. Let&rsquo;s face it, elevator pitches and business proposals are at least 80% claptrap. Turn on your TV right now - I&rsquo;d bet good money the majority of your stations are going to be playing commercials at this very second (or some sort of news program). That&rsquo;s two hundred channels of hogwash (especially those news programs - am I right?). I have sat through many a business conference whose agenda could easily be rewritten as drivel, prattle, a break for lunch, and finally light babble followed by a session of poppycock. To put it simply: Business is Baloney. You may be denying it right now, but search your feelings - on some level you know it to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the important thing, though: there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. That&rsquo;s just how people operate, whether it&rsquo;s business or anything else. Society is baloney. You can have a great idea, an unbeatable passion, or a brilliant mind, but if you don&rsquo;t have the bunk to back it up, you&rsquo;re going nowhere. Nonsense is important because it gives our thoughts structure. It transforms thoughts from mysterious unspoken things into real, tangible ideas. Think about this for a minute: you can think up a completely random thought in your brain and somehow transmit that thought in perfect high definition to someone else&rsquo;s brain using nothing but words. You just mind controlled somebody using pure, homegrown balderdash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fight that. Unlock it. Shape it. Manipulate it. Be the Emperor of Nonsense. Once you realize everything anybody has ever said has just been words somebody thought up, you have the greatest power of all: the power of nonsense. Once you learn that power, you&rsquo;ll be unstoppable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself, though (literally). I started this by introducing myself, and I ended up glossing right over that part and going straight to the nitty gritty without establishing just who I actually am. I got carried away with all of my mumbo jumbo. Let me take a step back, then, and establish some of my credentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may be a young whippersnapper, but I am pretty proud of where my career has taken me so far. I graduated from Purdue University with a degree doing computery things back in 2009, at the height of the Great Job Crisis that Christian Bale and Steve Carell created (at least I think so, I haven&rsquo;t seen that movie yet). That job crisis didn&rsquo;t affect computery jobs, as it turns out, so off I went to Chicago to earn fame and fortune making apps and websites and working for high profile marketing and technology companies. I was successful, too. Well, maybe not fame so much, but I was really quite successful as a computery, programmery sort of person. I have worked for small start-ups, gigantic corporations, and many things in-between. I became pretty well versed in the language and methodology of business and of corporate America. To put it another way, I have developed a keen grasp of nonsense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this was merely a day job, though, as I pursued my real passion, which began for me all the way back when I was a kid: goofiness - I mean, comedy. Goofiness is just something I was born with, like my left-handedness or my ridiculous height (though those both probably contribute to the goofiness, now that I think about it). Comedy, though, is a type of nonsense that is particularly special to me. Who doesn&rsquo;t love a good joke? Well, the Germans, I guess, but this isn&rsquo;t Germany. I learned early on how powerful a well-placed punch line can be, and chasing that power led me to study Improv.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent four years as a member of an Improv Comedy group at Purdue, and continued to pursue it in Chicago, studying at the prestigious Second City Training Center (people call it the Harvard of Comedy - seriously). I have studied movement, stage combat, Shakespeare, comedy, clowning, and mime (yes, even mime). By day I wore the tie of business and the pants of working in cubicles, and by night I switched the tie with the tie of comedy (they look very similar, but the comedy one is easier to wear on your head). I have discovered that these parallel lives I have been living are not, in fact, so different. Reacting quickly to change, thinking outside the box, solving problems - these are all major parts of Improv, as well as the world of ties and cubicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for those worlds to collide. I want to share what I&rsquo;ve learned about the strengths of Improv, and how these ideas and methods can - dare I say it - change the world! Join me, and by extension <a href='http://www.thespeakers-studio.com' target='_blank'>The Speaker&rsquo;s Studio</a>, in this new frontier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>. . . or maybe that&rsquo;s all just a bunch of nonsense - you be the judge.</p>\r\n",

      "title": "The Rules of Improv",
      "text": "<p>Imagine floating in space, free from gravity, direction, or orientation (you have a space suit with oxygen, though, so don&rsquo;t freak out). This is pure, undiluted freedom. Where do you go from there? Where <em>can</em> you go, without any force to direct you or frame of reference to orient you? As humans I think we all need rules of some sort to govern the things we do. It&rsquo;s comforting to have a structure to work within. We want to know that someone has spent time establishing a framework to keep us going in the right direction, or to keep us safe, or to keep everyone on the same page. This is one of the paradoxes of Improv: to experience freedom, we have to embrace our necessary structures. You can&rsquo;t think outside the box without knowing what the box is in the first place. Pure freedom is useless without some sort of structure or guidance. Improv, therefore, needs some structure to work around. Improv, despite being an exploration of creative freedom, still needs rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been doing Improv for over ten years now. To be fair, I guess, since basically everything is made up, I&rsquo;ve been doing improv for much longer than that. I&rsquo;m talking about official, laugh at me on stage, capital &lsquo;i&rsquo; Improv, not just &ldquo;making stuff up.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m talking about Improv as a performance style. I&rsquo;m talking about Improv as an art form. It really is, too. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I suppose I should be glad I held back from the argument that it&rsquo;s almost a religion. It&rsquo;s an incredibly deep and complicated system of beliefs and techniques, with millions of hours of study being conducted as we speak and thousands of different exercises, theories, games, lessons, and platforms being consumed, shared, and preached throughout the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me just take a moment to establish that you might not agree with me in any way on any of this Nonsense I throw out. That is okay. My goal is to establish the Things that I have observed in the world, and collate them into a set of concepts that work for me. What works for me might not work for you. However, I would ask that you open your mind and take a moment to see things my way, and experiment with my observations. Either you will discover new truths that do, indeed, work for you, or you will discover disgusting lies that will not - either discovery is important and valuable. Discovering a thing that does not work can be as important as discovering something that does. It will get you closer to your own truth either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to assume that anybody reading this is already meeting me halfway on the whole &ldquo;art form&rdquo; thing, or you&rsquo;re at least willing to grant me the olive branch of &ldquo;okay, sure whatever&rdquo; to see just what I have to say about it. I don&rsquo;t want to waste a bunch of time trying to make the very basic foundational argument, I want to move on to the implications of that argument. If Improv is an art form, or even a way of life in itself, what do we do with it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the basic level, though, let&rsquo;s just go ahead and define &ldquo;Improv&rdquo; so that we have that foundation upon which to build this system. Let us, at least for the sake of the next several paragraphs of text, define Improv as, &ldquo;empowering the nature of the Human Mind to drive creativity and success in a given field.&rdquo; Improv lives, of course, in the human mind, and it relies on the natural wiring and functionality of that mind to work. Most, if not all, techniques in Improv are designed to exploit (or perhaps simply direct) the way our minds work. Society conditions us to think in a very specific way, and Improv allows us to unlock that restriction and allow ourselves to think in any way we want. This unlocked mind can then be used to help us do anything, really, from comedy, to general creativity, psychotherapy, emotional awareness, personal development, leadership, public speaking, you name it. Simply put, capital &lsquo;i&rsquo; Improv makes us capital &lsquo;a&rsquo; Awesome. Of course, it isn&rsquo;t enough to simply tell someone that she can do anything, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improv is a very personal thing. It taps deep into that core, animal brain, deep in the sensitive, chewy nougat of one&rsquo;s psyche. This is the strength of Improv, but it also means that everyone who studies it has to develop their own rules. I therefore cannot in good conscience stand before you (or sit behind my keyboard) and declare the definitive, Buzzfeed worthy list of Ten Improv Rules That will Change Your Life. For one thing, it&rsquo;s still a relatively new art form that has not had time to chisel a series of commandments into any kind of stone tablets. For another, I don&rsquo;t know if there will ever be a definitive, ultimate list of rules. It&rsquo;s just too variable from person to person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I can share with you are my own personal rules, collected, adapted and organized from my discoveries and experiences. At least, I can share with you how my list looks right at this moment. It, like me, is still an evolving, living organism, and will probably continue to evolve and adapt for the foreseeable future. Feel free to take notes, consider how these rules might apply to your life (or your own Improv work), and adapt them for your own use. I claim no ownership over the nature of the human mind, and I therefore cannot claim to be responsible for any rules governing it. These are simply observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We start with the Prime Directive of Improv (don&rsquo;t worry, there will be a Star Wars reference later), which is the rather ambiguous phrase, &ldquo;yes, and.&rdquo; This is the most common rule in Improv, and so I will give it the least attention. You can find entire books (not to mention t-shirts) on the subject of &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; so there is little I can say on the subject that someone else hasn&rsquo;t already said and been paid a lot of money to say. The core concept is that you should always be accepting of ideas, and constructive. &ldquo;Yes, and&rdquo; forms a foundation, where saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; do not. In Improv - I would argue in all of life - all ideas are good ideas, and those offered freely and openly should always be built upon. If an idea doesn&rsquo;t sound &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for you, you can simply continue building on it until it does. Rejection gets us nowhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, and&rdquo; is the most common (I won&rsquo;t say important, but you can feel free to) rule in Improv because it really is the foundation for creativity. The fascinating thing is that all action is really reaction. Even the most creative, unique things in the world are still a reaction to something. Improv, too, though a world of freedom and possibility, is almost entirely reactive, not spontaneous. &ldquo;Yes, and&rdquo; is, at its core, a directive simply to react. Listen, pay attention, and respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can practice saying &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; at home. Find a friend, or a colleague, or that guy at work that everybody finds annoying. Strike up a conversation with them. For everything they say, respond with, &ldquo;yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; and then build on their idea. Tell them to do the same (probably a good idea because you might get in trouble if they catch onto the fact you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to everything they say). It doesn&rsquo;t have to be about anything specific, just start brainstorming something. You can quickly get into some pretty interesting territory, where you might not have found yourself otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s all the time we have for today. I know, I promised you a list and gave you only one thing. Why explain in a single post what I can eek out for several, though? I&rsquo;ll be back very soon with the next rule. Until then, what do you think? Do you agree or disagree with anything I have said so far? How has the concept of &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; come up in your life? How do you think embracing it could help you? Consider those questions as rhetorical or unrhetorical as you wish, taking into consideration the comment box below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more stuff like this, check out <a target='_blank' href='http://www.thespeakers-studio.com'>The Speaker&#039;s Studio</a>, or stay tuned for more posts here.</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "Defeating Mental Noise",
      "text": "<p>Occasionally it occurs to me that I don&rsquo;t remember locking my car. There I am, in the middle of Kroger or whatever, and I&rsquo;m wondering if I need to go back out to my car and make sure it&rsquo;s locked. My mind gets fixated on that idea and I can&rsquo;t focus on the task at hand. Then I get caught up in this mental pattern that I often find myself caught in. I get so busy thinking, calculating, and worrying about what&rsquo;s going to happen that I fail to experience it actually happening. The present moment gets washed out with noise.</p>\r\n<p>Noise, as it happens, isn&rsquo;t just about sound. You might hear the word &ldquo;noise&rdquo; and think about a large crowd of people or that airplane passing right over your head on its way to land at the airport, or maybe somebody listening to (insert your least favorite genre of music). Noise can also just be a series of &ldquo;irregular fluctuations that accompany a transmitted electrical signal but are not part of it.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a bunch of two-dollar words which basically mean that noise is simply unnecessary and unwanted junk that gets in the way.</p>\r\n<p>I often encounter noise in photography. An option on most cameras these days is called the &ldquo;ISO&rdquo; setting. Without getting into too much mumbo jumbo (even though I am a fan of that, as you may know), the ISO setting essentially sets the &ldquo;gain&rdquo; on the image sensor in the camera. Wait, now I have to define what that means. Well, &ldquo;gain&rdquo; is simply the mean ratio of the signal amplitude or power at the output port to the amplitude or power at the input port. This paragraph has gotten away from me, and so maybe I should start over.</p>\r\n<p>Okay, so gain is just a multiplier. A higher gain multiplies a signal by a higher number, resulting in a more intense, or perhaps louder output. In photography we call this the &ldquo;ISO&rdquo; setting. In the world of audio, we call it &ldquo;volume.&rdquo; When you increase the volume on your (insert your most favorite genre of music), you&rsquo;re telling your stereo or whatever to take the signal and multiply it by a higher number, resulting in a louder output. What happens if you increase the volume too much, though? Anybody who has tried to impress their friends by turning their new stereo all the way up (because nothing is more impressive than temporary deafness) might have noticed that when you turn it all the way up, it starts to sound pretty awful - full of noise. Okay, so a good stereo is designed to not let you turn it up high enough to get to that point, just like a good camera is designed to not allow ISO numbers that degrade the image too much, but hopefully you get the point. When you increase the gain, you&rsquo;re multiplying all the extra garbage along with the actual signal you want to amplify. In the end, the noise takes over.</p>\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s go back once again to photography. If I increase the ISO setting on my camera, I&rsquo;m increasing the gain on the image. This is how, along with the shutter speed and aperture value, I am able to get pictures in lower light situations. If it&rsquo;s darker, there&rsquo;s less light to capture in the camera, which means I need to increase the gain on what light we have. However, what happens when I increase the gain too much? The picture looks terrible, because there&rsquo;s too much noise. Just take a look at those pictures you took with your cellphone telephone last night at the bar (or, if you&rsquo;re me, that late-night boardgaming session).</p>\r\n<p>Where else do we experience noise in our lives? Let me put it another way. Did you, like me, just take a moment to stare off in the middle distance and let your mind wander? Did you have to take a moment earlier to make sure your car is locked? These are examples of something I have come to know of as &ldquo;mental noise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>My mind likes to wander, especially in situations where I know I need to perform, or at least be put on the spot. In the professional world, there&rsquo;s always that situation where, to kick off a meeting, we start &ldquo;going around the room&rdquo; to introduce ourselves. As the turn gets closer and closer to me, my mind gets more and more distracted thinking or worrying about what I&rsquo;m going to say. Then, after my turn is over, I am still distracted, this time with analyzing and assessing what I said, and worrying about all the things I could have done better. If you were to ask me the names of the people on either side of me, chances are I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, because I was too busy worried about what I was going to say or what I said.</p>\r\n<p>The threat of mental noise is everywhere. As a performer, of course, I face it every moment I&rsquo;m on stage or otherwise in front of an audience. As a teacher, I face it every moment I am in front of a group of people expecting me to say something profound or amazing. As an individual, simply being addressed by someone else can send me spiralling down the rabbit hole of thoughts. I can of course only speak to my own personal experience, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not alone in this challenge. The act of losing oneself in one&rsquo;s own thoughts is, I think, rather universal to the human experience.</p>\r\n<p>Acknowledging this phenomenon is only the first step. It raises a few obvious questions. Why does this happen? What purpose does it serve? How do I control it, and if necessary stop it altogether? I&rsquo;m not sure I have all the answers, but the cool thing about Improv is that there are no wrong answers.</p>\r\n<p>So why does mental noise happen? It might seem obvious, but it might not be as cut and dry as it seems. I want to be successful, obviously, so when I&rsquo;m given an opportunity to speak it makes sense that I am going to endeavor to speak as well as I can. Why, though, is my natural mechanism in preparation of impending action to shut down and block out my situational awareness? Shouldn&rsquo;t that pumping adrenaline and fight or flight response kick in, making me more aware of my surroundings so I can react more quickly? Why does my mind instinctively look inward instead of outward?</p>\r\n<p>At some level, we all have a creative process, I think. As a writer and, if I may be so bold, an intellectual (fine, you can say &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; if you really want), I have spent many years developing my creative process. When writing - which I happen to be doing right this minute - I am able to led ideas form and coalesce. I can skip around as ideas come to me. I can go back and erase whole sentences or paragraphs (or perhaps start over if one starts to get too technical). When I am standing in front of other people, I don&rsquo;t have that luxury. I need to respond in the moment, and I only get one chance to say the perfect thing. It probably also doesn&rsquo;t help that I can look right at the faces of the people listening to me, so I will be able to see the precise moment I say something stupid. Thinking in the moment means I need to think harder and faster than I normally would, so I subconsciously push my brain to work harder.</p>\r\n<p>Just like when taking pictures or listening to music, I naturally want to multiply my mental power as much as I can, and just like in a camera or stereo, when I turn up the gain too high, the signal gets washed out with noise.</p>\r\n<p>Is mental noise helpful? The argument could be made that keeping a running narrative on a situation could be helpful, I suppose. However, it isn&rsquo;t helpful when it is distracting me from a situation, because that defeats the whole purpose. In order to react in the moment, you have to be in the moment. You have to be present. If I learn to control the mental noise, I can then use it when it is advantageous to me, and shut it down when it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>Handling noise is a simple technical process in photography. First, knowing what ISO levels are acceptable is very important. I know that when I reach a certain point the noise will be too much, so it&rsquo;s a simple matter of staying below that threshold. Modern cameras have a few tricks up their sleeves, too. Noise on an image sensor isn&rsquo;t entirely random, as it turns out. Each sensor has a certain pattern of noise that develops which can actually be predicted. Through a very sophisticated set of calculations and computations a camera is actually able to negate at least some of its own noise before it even processes the image (it&rsquo;s rather aptly called &ldquo;noise reduction&rdquo;). This is all very magical and awesome, but it&rsquo;s ignoring one simple fact of physics. In low light situations, you don&rsquo;t actually have to turn up the gain at all. You can simply be patient and let in more light.</p>\r\n<p>You may or may not be surprised to know that the human brain is actually quite a bit more sophisticated than even the most expensive digital camera. It might surprise you, however, to know that all of those noise reduction techniques apply to mental noise, too. First, it&rsquo;s important to know what amount of wandering is acceptable for my mind to do. In what situations am I more likely to experience noise? Knowing what to expect means I can work to avoid those situations or prepare myself for the likelihood of distraction. Then, just like a camera uses an understanding of noise to negate it, by recognizing and acknowledging my mental noise, I can negate that, too. You might be surprised at how simply acknowledging to yourself that your mind is wandering will allow you to bring your focus back to the here and now.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the most powerful tool in defeating noise is simply patience. It takes practice, but it comes down to telling your brain to just be cool and have faith.</p>\r\n<p>I think about those times I start to worry whether I locked my car or not. The thing is that I have never once actually forgotten to lock my car (well, maybe a couple times, but only at home under extenuating circumstances). It&rsquo;s a simple habit for me to pull the handbrake, turn off the car, take off my seatbelt, get out of the car, grab my backpack if necessary, and then hit the button to lock the car. It just happens automatically, to the point where I don&rsquo;t even think about it. I don&rsquo;t even remember doing it. I am worrying about nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Just like locking my car, I have never failed to come up with a response to something in the moment. Sure, I might not say the most incredible, pithy, mind-blowing things all the time, but I never fail to say anything at all. Interacting with other humans is, arguably, what humans were built to do, so (at least within a margin of error) it literally comes naturally to us, as naturally as taking off a seatbelt or locking the car. Shutting down the noise doesn&rsquo;t come as naturally - at least to me. I have to make a conscious effort to engage my noise reduction. It means having faith in myself. It means taking a deep breath and telling my mind not to worry. It means reminding myself that one simple truth: <em>I got this</em>.</p>\r\n<p>You know what? <em>You do, too</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "What Bluetooth Headphones Should You Buy Today?",
      "text": "<p>When I was in college (this was like 2005 or something), my Mom (hi, Mom) got me a pair of wireless headphones. They operated over Bluetooth, and since this was long before the days of listening to music on your smartphone, and therefore long before Bluetooth was very ubiquitous at all, that meant they came with a little box you plug into the headphone jack of your media player. I remember being skeptical that they would work very well at all. There&rsquo;s plenty to be skeptical about, really. Isn&rsquo;t that little dongle going to get annoying? Is the battery life terrible? How good is Bluetooth at transmitting audio, even? Are they comfortable? Is a wire running from your ears to your pocket even that big of a deal? After just a few months wearing these headphones on my way to class, I was decided - wired headphones are for chumps.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/headphones/120166-logitech-wireless-headphones-for-ipod.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>These are they.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantages of bluetooth headphones are pretty clear. I can&rsquo;t over-stress how important it is to not have that cord hanging around all the time. It gets in the way, it gets tangled, and the nagging fear that it&rsquo;s going to break is always hanging over you. Since bluetooth can transmit more information than just audio, most (if not all) bluetooth headphones also include controls to pause, skip, and change the volume of what you&rsquo;re listening to (yeah, wired headphones can have that, too, but at least in my experience bluetooth controls are more universally compatible and cooperative). On a phone, bluetooth headphones can also serve as a bluetooth headset, so I can transition from listening to music to answering a call without having to fumble with my headphones. Although battery life is a concern you don&rsquo;t have with wired headphones, I&rsquo;ve found that bluetooth headphones will last plenty of time between charges, as much as a couple days of heavy, all day use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are people who spend a lot of money on crazy high end media players that will play uncompressed FLAC files and feature all sorts of other audiophile nonsense. They will use massive headphones that cost more than a used car. They will insist that such things are important and make a difference. Bluetooth headphones are not for them. Bluetooth headphones are for people who want to listen to music or podcasts while they&rsquo;re on the bus, or to drown out the monotonous, crushing silence of the modern workplace. They are for someone who listens to streaming music over various Spotiplay or Googlify services, which don&rsquo;t stream ultra-high-quality music anyway, or for listening to podcasts, which really don&rsquo;t require much. They are for someone who might want to listen to something while doing something else, perhaps something that would be much better if there wasn&rsquo;t this obnoxious piece of crap cord getting caught on every stupid son of a bitch thing that I walk past. They are for someone who doesn&rsquo;t expect high-fidelity, noise cancelled, perfectly balanced, crystal clear quality at all times. I don&rsquo;t want to imply that there isn&rsquo;t a difference between $100 bluetooth headphones and $2000 studio circumaural monitors. I&rsquo;m just saying that both are perfectly legitimate options to listen to things, and I&rsquo;m more interested in the former than the latter at this point in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up selling that pair my Mom got me on Ebay along with my iPod (because unlike wireless headphones, I was not hooked on the iPod), and replacing them with a pair from Creative (to go with my far superior Creative media player). When those up and died a year later, I switched to a pair from Motorola. When I ended up making the switch from separate music device to my phone (it seems silly now how much I thought about that decision at the time), those bluetooth headphones were able to make the switch with me, and I could ditch the obnoxious little dongle. Over the years my choice of headphones got smaller and lighter, until eventually I ended up with the LG HBS-700&rsquo;s, branded the LG Tone Wireless Stereo Headset.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/headphones/298335-lg-hbs-700.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Kind of a wacky-looking contraption, but they&rsquo;re great.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The main component goes around your neck, and then the two earbud-style doohickeys go in your ears (obviously). They attach back to the main device magnetically, so when you aren&rsquo;t using them they stay pretty compact and easy to store. Arrayed around the outside are the various controls for volume, track skipping, answering / hanging up on calls, and play / pause. The sound quality isn&rsquo;t breathtaking, but they are perfectly fine for listening to podcasts on the bus and listening to music at work. They are pretty negligible weight, and the design means you don&rsquo;t look like some sort of weird cyborg with giant headphones on. The headphone bits just look like normal old earbuds, and the neck piece can actually be hidden under clothing. They really are the best of both worlds, and they were one of those almost perfect devices that I carried with me and just trusted for years. I went through at least three phones in their lifespan, and lived in two cities and four different homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, though, all things end, and this winter finally saw the end of these venerable headphones. The plastic shell around one of the earbuds fell apart, and as a result the connection to the speaker inside was loosened. I tried to fix it, but it&rsquo;s just too worn out and I couldn&rsquo;t get it working again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that leads me to the whole reason I brought all this up: I need new headphones. It&rsquo;s a difficult prospect, to replace something that I was so entirely satisfied with. However, technology (and trends) have caught up with me, so there are more options now than I&rsquo;ve ever had for a good pair of wireless headphones. Let&rsquo;s head over to Amazon.com and take a look at what my options are.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1YvKLeq' target='_blank'>Bluedio Vinyl Plus Light Extravagance Wireless Bluetooth Headphones (Black)</a>\r\n<p>$249.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Bluedio-Extravagance-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B019DQWN8S/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=aht&dd=jyg9r61Vo_JF1EgtHXfgog%2C%2C&ddc_refnmnt=pfod&ie=UTF8&qid=1460657735&sr=1-1&refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A12097501011%2Cp_97%3A11292772011&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=1964c189f0f1b0608e913f9f3737853d' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B019DQWN8S&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B019DQWN8S' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose there&rsquo;s something to be said for a product that is upfront about it being an extravagance. Well, I guess these headphones simply feature an additional &ldquo;light extravagance.&rdquo; Nothing major, just a light extravagance. These are the highest-rated Bluetooth headphones on Amazon as of the time I am writing this, and they are more than twice what I would really expect to pay for some bluetooth headphones (all the ones I&rsquo;ve owned have been in the $100 range). They are also much larger than what I think I would like. I personally prefer the comfort and portability of earbud-style headphones to these big dudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that price it better have all the features you would want. I don&rsquo;t see any mention of built-in audio controls, although there are a few buttons on them, so there&rsquo;s at least something there. They seem to be able to function wirelessly or with a wire, which is always a great feature for when the battery dies and you want to still use them. The package apparently includes the headphones, an audio cable (for wired use), a charging cable (probably a standard micro-usb, which is universal these days), some sort of &ldquo;y cable,&rdquo; a cable with remote and mic, a carrying case with a buckle (what a light extravagance), a pouch for the cables, and a user manual. For wireless headphones, these sure have plenty of wires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, what in the world is a &ldquo;Bluedio?&rdquo; I think I&rsquo;ll pass on these, despite the good reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1NaXdj6' target='_blank'>ULDUM Bluetooth V4.1 Stereo Noise Cancelling Sweatproof Super Bass HiFi IN-Ear Bluetooth Headsets with Built-in Microphone for All Bluetooth Music Player Devices (Black-Red)</a>\r\n<p>$43.88</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Cancelling-Sweatproof-Microphone-Black-Red/dp/B017NJALJA/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=aht&dd=jyg9r61Vo_JF1EgtHXfgog%2C%2C&ddc_refnmnt=pfod&ie=UTF8&qid=1460658426&sr=1-9&refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A12097501011%2Cp_97%3A11292772011&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=653ce91408849d0b0a95c02eba2f5866' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B017NJALJA&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B017NJALJA' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Yikes, ULDUM, you really got all those keywords in that product name, didn&rsquo;t you?

      "text": "<p>The headphones that I used happily for the last several years have died, which means I need a new pair. I wanted to share with you, my adoring fan - hi, Mom - my process when I am looking to buy a new electronic gadget. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get some insights into things to look out for, or maybe you&rsquo;ll find a pair of headphones that you&rsquo;d like for yourself. This definitely has nothing to do with the fact that my birthday is coming up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I dive back into the available options, let&rsquo;s take a look at what features are out there in the world of wireless headphones these days. Here are some of the things I&rsquo;m interested in (in no particular order):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battery Life</strong> - Obviously wireless headphones have to operate under their own power, so how long will that power last? My old pair could easily last 12 hours on a single charge, so I would hope to match that. This is a difficult statistic to really measure without being able to just use some and see for myself, because it&rsquo;s hard to trust these numbers online. How much do various companies embellish these numbers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bluetooth 4</strong> - You might not know that we currently live in the age of the fourth revision of the Bluetooth wireless standard, but here we are. My phone supports Bluetooth 4, so obviously I want to take advantage of that with some headphones that also support it. What does that get me over previous Blueteeth? The main <a href='http://www.cnet.com/news/bluetooth-4-0-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter/' target='_blank'>buzz</a> over Bluetooth 4 is the fact that it can operate in a Low Energy state (called LE), and thereby use much less power. This could certainly be a good thing for battery life in both my new headphones and my phone, but in reality headphones probably won&rsquo;t take advantage of this feature, since they will be more interested in sending as much data as possible to achieve better audio quality. I therefore am somewhat skeptical of this being anything but a buzzword to make headphones seem cooler, like the ridiculous contrast ratios you&rsquo;ll see listed for different TV and Monitor brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>aptX</strong> - This is another buzzword, but it could actually mean something. The <a href='http://www.aptx.com/howitworks2' target='_blank'>aptX</a> moniker refers to an audio CODEC (the algorithm used to compress the audio - MP3 and AAC are other audio CODECs). When Bluetooth was originally conceived, it was intended primarily for making phone calls, so the built-in audio compression algorithm has never been great at doing music. AptX was apparently designed by Qualcomm (or someone owned by Qualcomm, anyway) and is designed specifically to improve audio quality sent over a bluetooth signal. The idea is that Bluetooth has a very limited bandwidth to work with, so aptX uses some fancy whizzbang programming magic to encode audio really well. I won&rsquo;t presume to know anything at all about compression algorithms (it&rsquo;s mind-blowingly complicated stuff). However, headphones that support aptX <a href='http://www.cnet.com/news/can-aptx-give-you-better-sound-over-bluetooth/' target='_blank'>should offer better audio quality</a> than those that don&rsquo;t. The problem is that your transmitting device also has to support aptX, so that you can actually encode the signal into the new format. My phone is not listed on the aptX list of supported devices, but according to <a href='https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/DROID-TURBO-2-by-Motorola/AptX-Support-for-Droid-Turbo-2/td-p/3294049' target='_blank'>this forum post</a> (featuring someone supposedly working for Motorola), it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main feature I&rsquo;m interested in here is that aptX should be much lower latency than not using aptX. A problem with Bluetooth is that there&rsquo;s a slight delay when listening to something. It&rsquo;s less than a second, generally, but that&rsquo;s enough to be annoying if I&rsquo;m watching a video. Theoretically aptX will eliminate that lag, so watching Netflix with some aptX headphones should be a much more enjoyable experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wired option</strong> - I mentioned in my last post that some headphones have the option to connect a cord to them and bypass the Bluetooth feature altogether. This defeats the purpose of wireless headphones, of course, but it can still be handy when your battery dies or if you want to use them with a device that doesn&rsquo;t have Bluetooth - for example a Nintendo DS - or if you&rsquo;re on the airplane and those Bluetooth signals could crash the plane. My second wireless headphones, made by Creative, had this feature, and I did use it pretty regularly. However, no headphones I&rsquo;ve had since then have done this, and I haven&rsquo;t exactly missed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Near Field Communication</strong> - This is another buzzword which you might have heard lately. The latest iPhone made a big deal about the fact it supports NFC now (it&rsquo;s how Apple Pay works), even though most Android phones had the technology since at least 2010. NFC is basically a way for two devices to communicate with each other by touching. You can send an image from one phone to another, send your credit card information to a pay terminal, or send any other small snippets of information simply by touching two NFC devices together. On a device like wireless headphones or the <a href='http://amzn.to/22zJpR5' target='_blank'>little camera</a> I&rsquo;ve been using for a while (it&rsquo;s an excellent, albeit expensive, little camera), NFC is implemented to help you pair devices. The idea is that instead of having to go to your bluetooth settings to find your headphones, you&rsquo;ll just touch your phone to them and it will take care of the rest automagically. This isn&rsquo;t a make-or-break feature for me, because I have no problem with taking a minute to pair headphones with my phone. Once they are paired, every time you turn the headphones on, they reconnect. It isn&rsquo;t a big deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Built in controls</strong> - One of my favorite thing about the Bluetooth headphones I&rsquo;ve had is that I can pause what I&rsquo;m listening to right on the headphones. This means if someone tries to talk to me I can easily just pause my music and pop them out of my ears without having to fumble with my phone. I definitely would want my new headphones to have buttons for play/pause, skipping tracks, changing the volume, and answering calls. For the record, this is a Bluetooth standard called &ldquo;AVRCP,&rdquo; or Audio/Video Remote Control Profile. Any bluetooth device with a play/pause button, from the speaker in your shower to your car uses AVRCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Active Noise Control</strong> - This feature is something you see very little in smaller headphones, and basically not at all in Bluetooth ones. Without getting into too much detail, active noise cancellation essentially uses magic to literally erase background noise from your ears. That sounds ridiculous, but it really <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control' target='_blank'>is a thing</a>. I&rsquo;ve seen it implemented in larger headphones with mixed results, and it isn&rsquo;t really something I&rsquo;ve ever felt like I needed. Even with headphones, I usually want to be at least somewhat aware of what&rsquo;s happening around me - you know, just in case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Water Resistance</strong> - I&rsquo;m not going to go swimming with my headphones on or anything, but I would like to know that if I get caught in the rain or something I don&rsquo;t need to panic about them. This is often listed for headphones as being &ldquo;sweat proof&rdquo; which is just a more gross way of saying a little water won&#039;t destroy them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Integrated Equalization</strong> - A lot of offerings have some sort of built-in nonsense to try to offset the fact that Bluetooth doesn&rsquo;t sound that great. Some brands call it &ldquo;bass management&rdquo; but the point is that it pass the signal through a filter which tries to spruce it up a bit. I usually don&rsquo;t care for this kind of stuff, because most of it is pretty superficial and just thrown in to make a product look cooler. I am therefore more interested in whether or not these features can be disabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheesh, once you get me going I&rsquo;ll talk all day apparently. At least this time I&rsquo;ve done a bit of research ahead of time, and so I actually have a list of options that are legitimate options. Basically I just did a couple Google searches for &ldquo;best bluetooth headphones&rdquo; or &ldquo;bluetooth earbuds&rdquo; and checked out the first couple results. The good thing about Google is that the results are weighted by how much traffic the results actually get, so you can put a little bit of stock in something that comes up in a google search. I usually read what these people have to say, and take their thoughts into consideration with everything else. Knowledge is power, after all. This can be a good way to, for example, see real-world figures on battery life and stuff. Anyway, let&rsquo;s take a look at what I found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1MwpW1Z' target='_blank'>Creative Sound Blaster Jam</a>\r\n<p>$37.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Blaster-Ultra-Light-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B00SA1IAWG/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1460660692&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=sound+blaster+jam&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=3c402194abf9105378e3d06904e5e1c0' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA1IAWG&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00SA1IAWG' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, the first headphones that I might actually buy. As I was saying in my last post, Creative has made a lot of mistakes in their product offerings (and they also had the unfortunate pleasure of putting a lot of stock in a product that tried to compete with the iPod, and then having their major business basically made irrelevant by Windows, which is a story for another day). However, they aren&rsquo;t terrible, and these headphones have some good reviews. They&rsquo;re pretty simple (as you might expect for that price), with no wired option. However, the battery life seems respectable (the product page promises 12 hours, which means it meets my expectations, if I can trust the product page). They also have NFC, which is a feature I have no interest in one way or the other. They promise a &ldquo;one tap bass management&rdquo; feature, too. Creative historically knows their stuff when it comes to audio equalization, at least in my experience, so I bet this implementation isn&rsquo;t terrible, and it can be disabled with &ldquo;one tap&rdquo; so that&rsquo;s good to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, though, I can&rsquo;t get over just how awfully boring these things look. As much as I loved 1996, I don&rsquo;t need headphones from then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1NqL3O4' target='_blank'>Sony H.ear in Wireless Headphone, Black</a>\r\n<p>$199.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Sony-H-ear-Wireless-Headphone-MDREX750BT/dp/B01CQXGCXM/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=aht&ie=UTF8&qid=1460661080&sr=1-32&refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A12097501011&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=ea526d760ed124b86cd290d452191947' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01CQXGCXM&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01CQXGCXM' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I was clearly not the only person who really liked those LG headphones, because that around the neck design has become pretty much a standard form factor. Take, for example, these from Sony. They don&rsquo;t seem to have magnetic magic to keep the earbuds from flopping around when it&rsquo;s in your backpack, which is not a trivial complaint. I would be worried they will get damaged with how much they are allowed to just hang loose. They&rsquo;re also a bit pricey. Also, ugh, &ldquo;H.ear.&rdquo; Come on, Sony, give me a break. These also support NFC (Sony is going to start putting NFC into eyeglasses soon), and they use Sony&rsquo;s proprietary LDAC protocol, which is basically their version of aptX. This means it&rsquo;s useless to you unless you have a device that can transmit an LDAC signal, which in classic Sony fashion is limited to only Sony devices. The controls seem to be doubled up, with the same buttons doing volume and track skipping, which must be awkward. Finally, the battery life is a paltry 7.5 hours. All in all, they definitely don&rsquo;t seem worth the price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1qKezJH' target='_blank'>LG Tone Infinim HBS-900 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset</a>\r\n<p>$89</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/LG-Infinim-HBS-900-Wireless-Headset/dp/B00R9RF0EI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1460661253&sr=8-4&keywords=lg+wireless+bluetooth+headset&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=d3475acd7d5d3f5ef6c98156825ce7cc' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9RF0EI&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00R9RF0EI' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s going to be pretty underwhelming if I go through all this research just to get the updated version of the headphones I am replacing. Still, though, it seems like a no-brainer at this point. These should be pretty much the same thing as the ones I had, with a few improvements. The earbuds are now made by Harmon/Kardon, which is a good thing I guess. Also, the wires are apparently retractable now, which I suppose could make storage even easier, though I would worry that it puts unnecessary strain on those tiny wires. How does that mechanism work? Is it just another thing that could break? It would be underwhelming indeed to end up with perfectly good headphones that I can&rsquo;t use because the retractable wire mechanism stopped working. Still, these are on the short list of viable options. They only support Bluetooth 3, for whatever that&rsquo;s worth, but they do have an aptX logo right on the side. LG claims up to 14 hours of enjoying music time, which means they are a little better than the older ones. The name &ldquo;Infinim&rdquo; is the least obnoxious option so far. What does that say about this world we live in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/263Yyys' target='_blank'>LG HBS-910 Tone Infinim Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black</a>\r\n<p>$114.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/LG-HBS-910-Infinim-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B01CURH6TI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1460661253&sr=8-14&keywords=lg+wireless+bluetooth+headset&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=c8f492046d4c3b8d3835df02d7c805a7' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01CURH6TI&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01CURH6TI' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not all, because the 900&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t even LG&rsquo;s final form. Where those Creative headphones look like they&rsquo;re from 1996, these look like they&rsquo;re from 1996&rsquo;s crazy dystopian future, which I&rsquo;m totally okay with. Are there actually any differences between these and the 900&rsquo;s, though, other than the design and the higher price tag?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do companies do this? If you search for &ldquo;LG Tone&rdquo; on Amazon, you get (no joke) 28,359 results. Okay, I&rsquo;m not going to be diving down through all that, but just on the first page you have the LG HBS-750 (Tone Pro), HBS-900 (Tone Infinim), HBS-810 (Tone Ultra), HBS-910 (Tone Infinim), HBS-760 (Tone Pro), HBS-850 (Tone Active Premium), HBS-800 (Tone Ultra), and the HBS-730 (Tone+). We know they also had the HBS-700 (Tone), because those are the ones I own already. All of these things are basically the exact same product. Why do they need at least nine different models of wireless bluetooth headphones, all on the market at the same time? Different price points I can understand, but nine different options is absurd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just like the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. Now, I have one and it&rsquo;s great, but it was purchased for me so I never had the pleasure of trying to pick it out. I have since seen the Sonicare shelf in stores, and it&rsquo;s a joke. They have at least six different versions of a little white tube with a button on it and a vibrating brush sticking out the top. Why? Look at vacuum sweepers, cameras, laptops, TV&rsquo;s, even lawnmowers. At the risk of sounding like Andy Rooney here, there are simply too many options these days. Maybe the reason people are so enamored with Apple is not because any of the features or style, but because (until recently) there&rsquo;s only one iPhone to buy. There&rsquo;s no legitimate reason to make two different basically identical products, is there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, this little adventure is getting out of hand. Where were we?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to what I could dig up on the internet (&ldquo;by Googling HBS 910 vs 900&rdquo;), the 910 features better microphones than the 900, and improved speakers. I guess they sound better and work better in phone calls, which are admittedly legitimate things related to bluetooth headphones. The 910&rsquo;s support Bluetooth 4, where the 900&rsquo;s are only Bluetooth 3. According to LG the 910&rsquo;s will only give you 10.5 hours of music time, which definitely goes against the low power promises of Bluetooth 4. Also, I am not sure where the buttons are on the 910&rsquo;s, which makes me concerned they have some sort of awkward touch sensor which you just know isn&rsquo;t going to work as well. I&rsquo;m just not sure these are worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/2641hrY' target='_blank'>Samsung Bluetooth Headset for Android Smartphones</a>\r\n<p>$51.49</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Headset-Android-Smartphones/dp/B00ODDNPNO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1460663237&sr=8-1&keywords=samsung+wireless+bluetooth+headset&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=73732d51b5f8f1a4ddf791fc653dd4cc' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODDNPNO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00ODDNPNO' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung also has an option for this. From the pictures, it looks like it&rsquo;s some sort of hat that transforms into a paperclip? I think they went for form over function on this one. It has a clunky mechanism that goes around your neck and two big clunky ear pieces? Why does it need both? The beauty of the LG design is that when you&rsquo;re wearing it you just have normal, old earbuds in your ears. With this thing you have to have those big leaches making you look like a total dweeb all the time. If I was going to look like a dweeb anyway, I could just play my podcast about nerd stuff out loud and save $50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1WvHj5f' target='_blank'>Phiaton BT 100 NC Black Wireless & Active Noise Cancelling Neck Band Style Earphones with Mic</a>\r\n<p>$99</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Phiaton-Wireless-Active-Cancelling-Earphones/dp/B00YQGFY8C/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1460687969&sr=8-1&keywords=Phiaton+BT+100+NC&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=7fc4c2dbed8feaf40d951715527cf6b2' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQGFY8C&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00YQGFY8C' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re now straying back into the world of companies I&rsquo;ve never heard of. These guys seem legit, though, because they have some high praise around the Google results. These are noteworthy for a few reasons, but primarily to show something that happens all the time when you go shopping for gadgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On paper, these headphones have it all. They have Bluetooth 4 and aptX, twelve hour music time, and all the controls you could want. They even have a feature for wired use when the battery runs out, and they&rsquo;re the only Bluetooth headphones I could find that have active noise cancellation. They&rsquo;re that tried and true form factor and the reviews from various tech blogs speak very highly of them. However, the reviews on Amazon do not. There&rsquo;s never an easy solution, it seems. A lot of the Amazon users point to poor Bluetooth connectivity, which could certainly be a problem. If they won&rsquo;t work while my phone is in my pocket and they&rsquo;re all the way up on my head, what good are they? It basically comes down to whether you want to take the risk for noise cancellation and wired functionality, because that&rsquo;s all these have over the LG ones. I&rsquo;m not sure whether those features are worth it or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1WvHnSj' target='_blank'>SOL Republic Shadow Wireless In-Ear Headphones</a>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/SOL-REPUBLIC-Shadow-Wireless-Headphones-Black/dp/B00VDES2SE/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1460688170&sr=8-1&keywords=Sol+Republic+Shadow&linkCode=li3&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=2565ec7faf43d7d088c537e933be07ab' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDES2SE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00VDES2SE' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>These also have some good reviews out there in the Interworld, but I&rsquo;m not sure why. With only eight hours of battery life and the same dangling earbuds as the Sony options, I don&rsquo;t see any reason to pick these over the LG ones. Also, it seems like only the white ones are really available, and I do not have the lifestyle to support any kind of white accessories. I don&rsquo;t think these are for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/1VuADoW' target='_blank'>NuForce BE6 Superior Sounding Wireless Bluetooth Earphones</a>\r\n<p>$129</p>\r\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ACXA54/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=be6%20nuforce&qid=1444422403&ref_=sr_1_2&sr=8-2&linkCode=li2&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=b45733e711e031b1ebcfc45399970335' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B015ACXA54&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li2&o=1&a=B015ACXA54' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, somebody&rsquo;s a little sure of themselves, aren&rsquo;t they? &ldquo;Superior Sounding&rdquo; is quite a claim, but of course it&rsquo;s pretty meaningless. They could be Superior to a tin can, but what good does that do for me? The reviews I&#039;ve found on Google seem to back them up, though, so they supposedly do sound pretty great. With aptX and the latest Bluetooth whatevers, they have you covered on the technology front, but there&rsquo;s obviously no corded option or NFC (because where would those things go?). Just click that link and take a look at them, because these things definitely win the award for sleekest headphones. How much smaller could they even get? They only promise a paltry 6 hours of use, which is pretty pathetic, but considering how tiny they are I&rsquo;m surprised they even fit that much battery in there. The whole &ldquo;all aluminum construction&rdquo; thing is certainly a trendy gimmick, but considering the plastic shell was ultimately the downfall of my old headphones, I&rsquo;m not going to complain about the added durability. The question with these is whether the novelty of having such tiny little headphones is worth the cost in both price and inferior battery life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully that&#039;s enough selection for you. This is plenty for me, and I think most of these options would work pretty well as my new headphones. I should point out, of course, that I haven&rsquo;t used or experienced any of these things myself. I&rsquo;m entirely basing my opinions on what I&rsquo;ve read online, so I&rsquo;m not trying to review products I haven&rsquo;t used. I&rsquo;m just trying to discuss what I would spend my hard earned money on if I were going to buy one of these (or, you know, if my birthday was coming up or something). I have to assume, of course, that the audio quality on all these is at least similar enough that it doesn&rsquo;t make that much difference. The reviews suggest that they all sound fine, and with Bluetooth we can&rsquo;t expect them to really have breathtaking quality anyway. When picking out something like this, you have to weigh all the options and features, and the weird thing is that you kind of have to roll the dice a little bit on the feature you&rsquo;re actually going to use them for - listening to stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s hard to beat those LG Tones. They have a proven record and a good array of features for a great price. I&rsquo;m still not sure if the 910 option is really that much better than the 900 one, and the offerings from Phiaton and NuForce certainly complicate things further. I&rsquo;m not sure Phiaton is completely trustworthy, though, judging from the experiences of other Amazon customers, and I just don&rsquo;t think the trade-offs of those tiny NuForce buds are worth it, either. Therefore, it&rsquo;s down to the two LG models, and I don&rsquo;t think you could go wrong with either. I don&rsquo;t think the 910&rsquo;s offer much that would justify the price and the lower battery life. Therefore, I think my pick for my next pair of wireless bluetooth headphones is the LG Tone Infinim HBS-900 Wireless Stereo Headset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m just getting the newer version of what I had before. At least I&rsquo;ll know I did my research, though.</p>\r\n",

I don&rsquo;t think anybody would go to a single pilates class and expect to be ready for <a href='http://i.giphy.com/DSt9DkQVcfavK.gif' target='_blank'>Ninja Warrior</a>. You have to train your muscles over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, though, that you can be physically fit if you just work at it. <a href='https://www.verywell.com/can-anyone-run-a-marathon-2911437' target='_blank'>This random article</a> - the first result on Google for &ldquo;can anyone run a marathon&rdquo; - answers the question rather concisely in the first sentence. &ldquo;With the proper training, I do believe that anyone who is in good health can complete a marathon.&rdquo; The author goes on to elaborate, &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s a huge physical and mental endeavor and is not something to be taken lightly.&rdquo; You can do it, you just have to prepare yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it another way, what you practice grows stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even run a marathon or go on Ninja Warrior every day. Most people do use their <a href='http://i.imgur.com/6JnBAj3.gifv' target='_blank'>brains</a> everyday, though. Why don&rsquo;t we have gyms for creativity? Why don&rsquo;t we train our creativity muscles like we do our running ones?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. &ldquo;Some people just aren&rsquo;t creative,&rdquo; you might scoff. That&rsquo;s totally a fallacy, and the evidence proves it. Here&rsquo;s just one <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2pjN4Ne1ag' target='_blank'>TED Talk on the subject</a> (I think at least 75% of TED Talks are on the subject of how to be more creative). Dr. Roberta Ness, dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health, points out articles like <a href='http://www.newsweek.com/creativity-crisis-74665' target='_blank'>this one from Newsweek</a> decrying a &ldquo;creativity crisis&rdquo; that is sweeping the nation. She believes (as do I) that this creativity deficiency isn&rsquo;t just part of who we are - it&rsquo;s learned. She explains that it all comes down to &ldquo;frames&rdquo; that we get stuck in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do things because we&rsquo;re &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to do them. We say inside the box because the box is what we&rsquo;re used to. You think you aren&rsquo;t creative because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve always practiced. You (or perhaps the less accusatory &ldquo;one&rdquo;) have grown quite good at being uncreative. We are all couch potatoes of the <a href='http://i.imgur.com/j74SykU.gif' target='_blank'>mind</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to that article I linked to earlier, &ldquo;Can Anyone Run a Marathon?&rdquo; What if we apply the same logic to creativity? <em>I believe that anyone who is in good health can come up with amazing original ideas. However, it&rsquo;s a huge physical and mental endeavor and is not something to be taken lightly.</em> You can do it, you just have to prepare yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it another way, what you practice grows stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have all been practicing for so long to be a bunch of nice, homogenized little happy meals, tucked away in our boxes, following the rules and staying in line. I&rsquo;m as guilty as anyone, after spending ten years working in offices and selling out to <a href='http://i.imgur.com/1gZyJb3.gifv' target='_blank'>The Man</a>. We are really good at that, because that&rsquo;s what we practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if every time you think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not creative,&rdquo; you said &ldquo;my creativity is out of shape&rdquo; instead? You just need to go to the gym and work out. Why isn&rsquo;t there a gym for the mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://i.imgur.com/TMmlKMJ.gif' target='_blank'>Snark</a> alert: oh wait, <a href='http://thespeakers-studio.com' target='_blank'>there is</a>. It&rsquo;s called Improv. It&rsquo;s the practice of being in the moment and thinking quickly. It&rsquo;s pure creativity. It is the mental equivalent to weightlifting while running a marathon uphill underwater while using one of those weird <a href='http://atomictoasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Fat-Belt-3.jpg' target='_blank'>shaking belt machines</a> you used to see in the 50&rsquo;s. The best thing about it, though, is that doing Improv mostly involves a lot of laughing and having a good time instead of sweating and feeling like all your muscles are exploding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How often do you exercise your body? Can you say you exercise your creativity as often? Let&rsquo;s change our national mindset. We need a &ldquo;<a href='http://www.letsmove.gov/' target='_blank'>let&rsquo;s move</a>&rdquo; campaign for our brains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can help you start <a href='http://thespeakers-studio.com/keep-it-100' target='_blank'>right now</a>. Actually, my class doesn&rsquo;t start until September, but you get the idea. Let&#039;s get in shape!</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "The Basics of Git",
      "text": "<p>I want to try to explain how Git works, using a metaphor I just came up with. I&#039;m posting it here just so I can share it with anybody who might be confused about Git, or version control in general. If you have no interest in those things, you don&#039;t have to continue reading, because this will either be boring or make no sense to you. If you&#039;re on the other end of the spectrum and you are some sort of Git expert, you will probably also find this pretty boring (hopefully not completely inaccurate, though).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exploration does assume that you have a passing familiarity with Git. You&#039;ve done some cursory reading or a tutorial or two on how Git works. My intention here is not to tell you the absolute basics, but to help you wrap your head around a really complicated subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, let&#039;s <em>dive in</em> (pun intended - you&#039;ll see in a second).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Git done</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Git is the current standard system for doing what&#039;s called Version Control. Put simply, a Version Control system is used by programmers to keep track of changes to files. It allows an entire team to work on the same set of code without stepping on each others&#039; toes (at least not much), and it allows them to stay in sync with the latest code updates at any given point. Also it tracks everything so you can easily see who broke what, if something were to break. I don&#039;t want to get into the specifics about how Git is unique and different from other Version Control systems, because that would take all day probably, and I&#039;m already going to take all day just to explain the basics. I want to explain in simple terms how Version Control systems work, from the perspective of Git, since that&#039;s what most people use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version control works with a thing called a <strong>Repository</strong>. A Repository is essentially a folder, stored somewhere in the cloud, full of other folders and files. It is the entire project, be it an app for tracking your garden, the Reddit website, or, I don&#039;t know, a website for posting pictures of dogs barking at watermelons or something. Every project generally has its own Repository. There are plenty of resources to explain Repositories and whatnot, so I won&#039;t waste time re-explaining the wheel. I&#039;ll just get right to putting my own spin on it in the form of <strong>complicated metaphor</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Complicated Metaphor</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of a Repository like a river. It is a collection of <em>stuff</em>, flowing in one direction. Think of that <em>stuff</em>, the water and rocks and fish and stuff, as the files that are stored in the Repository. When that <em>stuff</em> gets changed, those changes are present in the river from that point onward. If you want the rocks to be a different shape, or you want to add another fish, you can do that. The river will only have those new things from then on. Everything is constant downstream, and nothing flows up-stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a <strong>special river</strong>, though - a river of the Imagination. Like any good thought experiment you kind of have to meet me half-way. Suppose that this special river is so densely populated with <em>stuff</em> that we can take a bucket (of the Imagination) and take a big scoop of the river at any point such that our bucket will contain everything in the river at that specific point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it another way, we can scoop out an exact duplicate of how the river exists at that point in its life. Any changes made to the <em>stuff</em> in the river before that point - any species of fish that we added or changes we made to the shape of the rocks or whatever - will be represented in our bucket. Any changes made after the place we scooped our bucketful will not be present in said bucketful. Are you with me so far?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Oh, right, I keep forgetting that I exist as text and you can&#039;t really answer my questions. I&#039;ll just assume I haven&#039;t lost you yet.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This process (scooping a bucketful of the river) is called either 'cloning' or 'checking out' or doing a 'pull' of the repository. Whenever I copy my repository to my computer, I&#039;m scooping up a bucketful of water from the latest point that the river has reached. When I make a 'commit' (followed by a 'push') to the repository, I am filling my bucket with all of the changes that I want to introduce into the river, further down stream. If we&#039;re being pedantic (and since we&#039;re talking about computer programmers, that&#039;s a given), I will also plant a flag in the riverbank at the point where I dumped my commit. The flag explains exactly what I added at that point, so I can always keep track of what went where.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Version Control powerful is that the river always exists, and any time I dump a bucket into it I&#039;m just adding it further down-stream. The water and all that stuff still flows exactly as it always has at every point up to the new commit. Any time I want, I can stroll up-stream and revisit the river as it existed before my meddling hands turned all the fish purple or something. I can even get a scoop of how it existed at any point and go from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To relate the river to Git, we can name the river 'origin' and call this flow of <em>stuff</em> the 'master' branch.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Do the thing</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m going to create a repository on Github and call it 'coolwebsite' - this is my river. It will live at http://github.com/shauvonm/coolwebsite (because ShauvonM is my github user account). To interact with my river, I&#039;ll use the Git command line interface, because that&#039;s the most efficient way to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Just to be clear, I have not actually created the coolwebsite repository - that&#039;s just a made up thing for this thought experiment.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git clone https://github.com/shauvonm/coolwebsite\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This command scoops up a bucketful of my river and dumps it out into a folder on my computer. There are many other ways to create and / or check out a repository, but in my opinion this is the easiest, and it&#039;s just an example anyway. Do whatever works for you.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I can add a file to my cool website. The bare minimum that you need for a website is an index.html page, so I&#039;ll just throw that out there so I can have something to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git add index.html\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Assuming I&#039;m inside the cool website directory in my command line (and assuming I have created that file somehow), this will add specifically that file to my bucket. Normally I would use the command 'git add -A' (note the capital A) to add every change made and be done with it, but I felt like being specific here. When in doubt, just use 'git add -A'.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git commit -m 'Adding index.html file'\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This sets up my bucket to be ready to dump into the river. I also add a message here which is what shows on the flag I&#039;ll stick into the riverbank where I dump my bucket. You have to add that message whenever you do a commit. You don&#039;t have to be like me and make all of your commit messages Iambic Pentameter (I&#039;m <a href='https://github.com/ShauvonM/speakersstudio/commits/master' target='_blank'>not kidding</a>), but please don&#039;t be like the dude I used to work with who always just made his messages ''. That helps nobody.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git push\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This is how I dump my bucket into the river, thus adding my 'index.html' fish to the ecosystem. The river will contain that file from now on, unless I removed it.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If someone else makes changes to the repository and I want to work with those changes, I can get another bucket of the river to update my local copy of the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git pull\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>In other words, grab a bucketful of any new <em>stuff</em> from the river. If nothing has changed from the bucketful you already have, pull won&#039;t do anything.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, if I want to add more files or change the contents of my index.html file, I can do that through the same process - add those changes to my bucket, commit to those changes with a message, and then push those changes to the repository. Eventually, I&#039;ll have all the stuff I need for a super cool website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I want to make big changes, I can do it in a separate branch.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Rivers Can Have Branches, Okay?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually a big project will reach a point where it has reached a certain point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>. . . let me take another crack at that . . .</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually a project hits a major landmark, and everything so far works great. Now it&#039;s time to begin a new big feature or change which could really impact the rest of the project. For example, let&#039;s say I really like how my river is shaping up, and all of the rocks, fish, plants, and other <em>stuff</em> are working well together. However, I want to experiment with changing one of the fish into a frog. It might take some time to do that, and in the meantime the river will be all weird with some sort of half-fish half-frog thing getting in the way. What I want to do is create a duplicate of my river so I can make these changes without upsetting the 'master' flow. I can simply split the river so that now it flows in two streams, 'master' and a new stream which I will call 'frog.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Git, this is called a <strong>branch</strong>. The river now flows down both paths, which each start with exactly the same <em>stuff.</em> I can make whatever changes I want to the 'frog' branch, and it won&#039;t effect 'master' (and vice-versa). They will continue flowing independently of each other forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git checkout -b frog\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This command both creates a new branch called 'frog' and switches to that branch. Just like with cloning, there are other ways to create a branch but in my opinion this is easiest. In order to actually create this branch on the River Origin, though, we have to make sure we push it to the repository.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git push --set-upstream origin frog\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This tells the repository that we have a new branch called 'frog' on river 'origin' and it makes sure that our bucket is set up to dump into that branch. Now if we check the repository on Github, we would see that there&#039;s another branch called 'frog.'</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We can make updates to the frog branch just like we did to master earlier, using 'git add,' 'git commit -m,' and 'git push.' This will only update the frog branch, because it is now flowing in a different direction than the master branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are still flowing nearby, though, so I can easily update one with the other&#039;s <em>stuff.</em> At any point I can update the 'frog' branch with any updates I make to 'master' by taking a bucket of water out of master and dumping it into frog.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git checkout master\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Now we&#039;re back on the master branch.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git pull\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Grab a bucket of water from master, to get any changes that have been made to it.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git checkout frog\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Return to the frog branch.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git merge master <strong>-m 'Updating with the latest code on Master'</strong>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Dump anything in the master bucket into the frog bucket, updating frog with whatever changes made to master since we made the new branch. If no changes were made to master, nothing will be changed on frog. <strong>EDIT: I originally didn&#039;t mention that you should include the '-m' flag when you make merges, just like you do with commits (because when you make a merge, it technically also creates a commit) You should include a message each time you do a merge or a commit.</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git push\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Don&#039;t forget this command (I often do), because without this you won&#039;t actually dump your bucket into the river.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I finish my grand experimentation and I&#039;m ready to introduce this frog-that-was-a-fish into the master branch of River Origin, I can easily merge the two branches back together.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git checkout master\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Return to the master branch.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git merge frog <strong>-m 'Adding Frog to the river.'</strong>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>This will take the two streams and merge them back together. <strong>EDIT: Don&#039;t forget your commit message.</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git push\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Remember, your changes aren&#039;t actually dumped into the river unless you use this command.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now River Origin is whole again. From here on, it will flow from this point with all of the changes made to the origin branch and the frog branch. If I turned around and looked at the river, it would split off for a while into two streams, before coming back together again. If I wanted to go back to how master was before the frog was added into it, I can do that by just returning to that point in the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branching is a tool that allows me to make changes to a repository in a safe, separate space. How I use branches is up to me (or my team). Some people create a new branch for every new feature, task, or change they want to make. Some people use branches to keep track of different versions of their code. Often the 'master' branch is reserved for only the latest released version of the code, and all changes made until the next release are done on a separate branch. Some people don&#039;t use branches at all. Those people are probably okay with their peas touching their mashed potatoes on their dinner plates, and they are therefore monsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, there&#039;s one more concept in Git that I want to explain using this river concept: forks. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>The Fork that isn&#039;t</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s suppose that you, completely on your own and not affiliated with me at all, see my 'cool website' river and think it would work perfectly for your own cool website. My repository is on Github and it&#039;s public, so it&#039;s totally within reason to make a copy of it for your own purposes. The legal, ethical, and technical specifics of all this is beyond the scope of what I&#039;m talking about, so let&#039;s just ignore it for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can take a bucketful of my river (check out or clone the repository) to your own computer and go to town, but any changes you make would be breaking my precious river that I have spent so much time on. You don&#039;t want your unique changes affecting my river, where they aren&#039;t applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could make a branch, then, where you could change whatever you want without getting in my way. The problem is that this will still clutter up my river with branches that you have no intention of ever merging back into the master stream. This is still not ideal, because there&#039;s  only one master branch, which won&#039;t end up being the 'master' branch of the crazy stuff you&#039;re doing. Someone else who comes along to look at the river will be super confused about what&#039;s going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you don&#039;t want to mess with my river or even make a branch from it. What you want is your own river. In Git, this is called a <strong>Fork</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to fork a repository is to just click the 'fork' button in Github. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a command for this, but it won&#039;t be easier than just clicking that button. When you do, it will create an entirely new repository in your Github account which is an exact duplicate of the one you&#039;re forking. You take a bucketful of the master branch of the first river and you create an entirely new river from the contents of that bucket. This won&#039;t copy all the branches or the history of the first river - you&#039;re getting a whole new river. Now you can go nuts doing whatever you want with your river and the one you forked from will not be affected in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Okay, okay, I realize that what we call a 'branch' in Git is more like a 'fork' in a river, what we&#039;re calling a 'fork' in Git is more like a 'clone' and a 'clone in Git is more of a 'fetch' or something. In my opinion, the terms for things in Git are kind of, well, stupid, but that&#039;s what they&#039;re called so that&#039;s what we call them. Welcome to computering, where forks aren&#039;t forks, your laptop has a desktop, and the cloud is definitely not a cloud.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, by making a fork, you can change whatever you want and I don&#039;t have to worry about it doing anything to my river. What if you discover a bug in my river (which I guess in this analogy could be an actual bug) and you have a good solution for fixing that bug? You can put a bucket together which includes a fix or change and you can submit it to me to have me dump it into my river. I can take a look at the contents of your bucket and choose to add it into my master branch. In Git, this is a '<strong>pull request</strong>.' You are making a request to me, the repository owner, to pull your changes into the original repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a command for this, but it&#039;s easiest to just do it through Github, on the page for your fork. This is a pretty advanced scenario that you may never even encounter, but still it&#039;s good to know about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pull requests happen all the time on some of the bigger repositories. Take a look at the Reddit <a href='http://github.com/reddit/reddit' target='_blank'>repository</a> and check out the 'pull requests' tab. Those are all buckets that people have submitted to the Reddit team to change something about how Reddit works. They can discuss each item and decide to either dump it in or reject it. Yes, this means that literally anyone in the world could potentially make changes to Reddit (or make a fork and start their own Reddit, theoretically). That is the power of open source and version control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s look at one last scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>One Last Scenario: Updating a Fork</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you have a fork - a duplicate - of my river that you are making changes to. I push some updates to my master branch which you would really like to have. Your fork was made from my river before I made those changes, though, so as far as your river is concerned, they don&#039;t exist. How do you get those updates into your river?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&#039;t have to go through and make all the same changes yourself. It&#039;s actually just a matter of a few commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git remote -v\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This will list all of the URL&#039;s linked to your clone of the repository, under the 'origin' label (remember, that&#039;s what we called our river). Basically, this is where your buckets go when you push, and where the buckets come from when you pull. When you make a fork, the only URL listed here will be your fork&#039;s (https://github.com/youruser/coolwebsite for example), not the original repository. We need to change that.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git remote add upstream https://github.com/ShauvonM/coolwebsite\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>This will tell your computer to add the original repository as the 'upstream' source for your fork. Your river is technically down-stream from mine, and by using this command you can make it official. Note that this URL is made up, you would replace it with the URL of whatever you have forked.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git remote -v\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Now you&#039;ll see my URL listed with yours, under the 'upstream' label. Your river is always 'origin' - the river you forked from is 'upstream.'</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git fetch upstream\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>This will pull down the latest state of upstream. In other words, it fills up a bucket with the latest <em>stuff</em> in my river.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git checkout master\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>Switch to the master branch of your repository. You can replace 'master' with whatever branch you want to merge my code into.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git merge upstream/master <strong>-m 'Updating my fork from upstream.'</strong>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='caption'>This pulls in the changes from the master branch of the upstream river and dumps it into your river. This is the same thing I did earlier to update a branch in my river. This time you just specify that you want my (upstream) master branch instead of your (origin) master branch. <strong>EDIT: Again, include a commit message to future-you here.</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully at this point you know what comes next.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style='width: 80%; margin: auto; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px; background: #666; color: #FFF'>\r\n&gt; git push\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='caption'>Never forget to push.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Now You Are An Expert</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully now you have a working mental image for how Git repositories work, and how you can use branches and forks. This just scratches the surface, of course, and it doesn&#039;t get into what might happen if, for example, you have conflicts when you try to merge branches, or how you plug in your git credentials. However, it&#039;s a start, and on a day-to-day basis this encompasses about 90% of my interaction with Git on a major project out in the wild (and I have been on quite a few).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this stuff is really complicated, especially when using the command line to interact with it. However, once you get that mental image in your head that helps you visualize what&#039;s going on in a repository, the command line tools will be second nature. Hopefully this whole river metaphor will help you develop that mental image.</p>\r\n",

      "text": "<p>I&#039;ve often thought that if I was in charge of a TV studio, a fun thing to do would be to air nothing but Holiday episodes of TV shows in December. Pretty much every show has at least one Holiday episode, so you could probably fill a schedule with nothing but these episodes from every single TV show ever. Now, I&#039;m not (and will probably never be) in charge of a TV network, but thanks to living in the future, we can basically be our own TV networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I think is really fun is Advent Calendars. If you aren&#039;t familiar, these are basically little boxes with a compartment for each day in December leading up to Christmas. It&#039;s very exciting cracking open 25 little compartments to get a half-melted piece of chocolate or tiny Lego every day. Now, I&#039;m not (and will probably never be) Christian, so the symbolism and religious overtones are lost on me, but who doesn&#039;t like getting a little surprise every day?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, these days I find that I could use any little dumb excuse to be excited about something for a change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, this year I figured I would put these two Random Holiday Thoughts together into one Marginally Interesting Idea to share with my reader(s). I will be presenting a little advent calendar for you, posting a new interesting tidbit once a day starting tomorrow, December 1, and going all the way to December 25. The theme this year will be random Holiday episodes of TV shows that I like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rules are pretty simple. No made-for-TV movies or holiday specials. These will strictly be regular episodes of TV shows that just happen to be Christmas or Holiday themed. This isn&#039;t a 'best of' or some sort of link-bait 'listicle.' These aren&#039;t ordered in any specific way or representative of my 25 favorite anything. These are simply 25 episodes of almost as many TV shows (there are a couple repeats) that I either like, remember from my childhood, or otherwise find noteworthy or interesting.  Let&#039;s set aside our opinions and this weird Internet need to find the 'best' of everything, and just be cool for a little bit this Holiday season.\r\n\r\n<p>So tune in every day for the next 25 days and read about a specific blast from the ghost of Christmas Past. Maybe you will remember some of them, maybe they&#039;ll remind you of how TV has evolved over the years, or maybe they&#039;ll help you get into some awesome shows you&#039;ve never watched but totally should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of a TV show that you should definitely start watching . . .</p>",

      "text": "<h5>\r\n<em>RuPaul&#039;s Drag Race</em> Season 3, Episode 2\r\n<br />'The Queen who Mopped Xmas'</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally broadcast January 24, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.denyconformity.com/assets/images/advent2016/rupaul.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>Just in case somebody was expecting me to start out with some episode of <em>Frasier</em> or <em>The Wonder Years</em>, I figured I would kick the Advent off with possibly the most radical selection from my list. The thing is, though, that this shouldn&#039;t be radical at all. You should all be watching this show.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>World famous drag queen RuPaul hosts this competition reality show in which a group of queens from around the world compete to be America&#039;s Next Drag Superstar. If you have to be reductionist, it&#039;s kind of a mix of <em>America&#039;s Next Top Model</em> and <em>Project Runway</em>. I am not normally a fan of reality TV, but RPDR is one of my favorite things. In a world where we treat minorities like spectacles, here&#039;s a show where immigrants, transgendered people, and felons are just regular contestants. This is a world where 'normal' doesn&#039;t exist - and it&#039;s fabulous. Come for the wild, crazy, incredible performances, and stay for the truly heartwarming compassion and community that this show welcomes us into with open arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#039;re put off by the whole gender pronoun thing or some other silly preconceived notions about cross-dressers, there&#039;s no better opportunity to learn how to get over yourself and just sit back and enjoy something that is outside your usual comfort zone for once. It&#039;s important to remember that the holidays aren&#039;t just for straight, white, 'normal' people, especially since the rest of this list mostly consists of straight, white, 'normal' people - except for the ones who are yellow, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically this is the second episode of the third season of RuPaul&#039;s Drag Race, but the first episode is more of a preview of the season and its contestants, so this is really the first. That means it&#039;s a great place to start watching the show, and it just happens to be Christmas themed. It originally aired on January 24, 2011. They missed the holiday by a month, but who cares?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are introduced to the season&#039;s competitors, and the third season of the show had some really great ones. It probably wasn&#039;t the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul&#039;s_Drag_Race_(season_6)' target='_blank'>best season</a> of the show, but it definitely wasn&#039;t the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul&#039;s_Drag_Race_(season_7)' target='_blank'>worst</a>, and it features some of the most noteworthy queens to ever walk that runway. We meet the super shady Delta Work and Venus D-Lite. We meet the gorgeous Manila Luzon. There&#039;s the train wreck that is Mimi Imfurst, and the stunning Carmen Carerra. Alexis Mateo and Stacy Layne Matthews are incredibly endearing, and Yara Sofia is just breathtaking and out of this world (seriously, if you aren&#039;t going to watch the show, at least look her up). Raja is in a league of her own, and of course there&#039;s also Shangela. Finally you have the usual collection of 'others' who either don&#039;t make it very far or don&#039;t impress me enough for me to really remember them (my apologies to any India Ferrah fans out there).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is the regular format of the show, we get some critiques from the show&#039;s usual judges (RuPaul and the wonderful Michelle Visage, as well as the notably less wonderful Santino Rice), and two special guest judges (spoiler: one of them is Vanessa Williams!). At the end, the two worst queens of the night have to lip-sync for their lives, and RuPaul picks one to send home. It&#039;s a fun 45 minutes, and it will most likely leave you wanting to continue straight on to the next episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>See it on <a href='http://www.logotv.com/full-episodes/7qgtkm/rupauls-drag-race-the-queen-who-mopped-xmas-season-3-ep-302' target='_blank'>Logo&#039;s website</a>, since for some reason Hulu and Amazon starts at season 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What do you need to know?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s the first episode of the season, so you&#039;ll catch on to the show&#039;s format. However, I feel like I should mention Shangela, because she is presented (literally) in the episode as kind of a big deal. She was in the second season and eliminated in the very first episode, but she&#039;s just enough of a wacky Reality Show Character that the producers wanted to give her a second chance. Here she is in all of her catch phrasing, hyper confident glory, poised right on that razor&#039;s edge between 'edgy' and 'obnoxious.' For the most part she barely squeaks in on the good side of that line, in my opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Look, I&#039;m not your boss or anything, so I have no control over what you do. The choice is yours whether or not you actually watch any of my advent calendar selections. However, if you only watch one show that I mention in the next 25 days, please make it this one - especially if this is the one show you feel the most awkward about. It is incredibly important - not just because of the diversity and social justice issues, but just because it&#039;s a great show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus you get to see Vanessa Williams, and how often do you get to say that? Actually, speaking of Vanessa Williams . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

There are plenty of people who can tell you all about the historical context of the 24th season of the show, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s all fascinating. However, we aren&#039;t here to talk about a show that has somehow remained popular for over forty years. We&#039;re here to look at just one episode. You probably know it, and you probably (for some inexplicable reason) love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#039;t know what SNL is at this point, it&#039;s probably on purpose. I don&#039;t want to waste your time explaining something that you&#039;ve apparently been actively avoiding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, here goes: Saturday Night Live is a long running sketch variety show which has remained a mainstay of late night TV programming since its debut in 1975. Each Saturday night a different celebrity host leads an ensemble cast through a litany of mostly awkward comedy, interspersed with a performance or two from a musical guest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s be honest here, SNL has never really been brilliant, except for arguably in the good old days of whatever particular decade you consider to be the the good old days. What it generally promises is perfectly acceptable mediocrity. That isn&#039;t a bad thing. The ability to maintain a steady plateau of quality for so long (even if it&#039;s a rather shallow plateau) amid the garbage that is about 80% of other TV content is admirable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, this isn&#039;t about <em>OPINIONS</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/schweddy.png' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Yes, it&#039;s <em>this</em> one.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite a few moments from SNL&#039;s history have managed to work their way into the zeitgeist (sometimes even successful feature films). The last episode from 1998 spawned exactly one classic bit which NBC has been more than happy to dig up and toss out whenever they want to throw together one of their various 'Best Of' shows. If you haven&#039;t at least heard of this classic holiday sketch, you&#039;re, again, probably actively avoiding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s not to say, though, that it&#039;s the only highlight from the episode (in fact, I wouldn&#039;t even call it a highlight, to be honest). The opening monologue sees regular host Alec Baldwin going on a pretty entertaining riff on the classic Christmas Carol story. It includes a moment where Baldwin visits the 'host of Christmas future' and witnesses Jimmy Fallon hosting SNL in far off distant 2011. It probably seemed like a crazy thought back in 1998, but it turned out that by 2011 Fallon had been hosting his own show on NBC for two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s the usual slate of topical jokes on display, and in 1998 nothing was more topical than that whole Clinton Impeachment scandal. I tell you, it&#039;s worth watching this show just to be able to revisit, for a fleeting moment, a pre-9/11, pre-warming, pre-recession, pre-Iraq (well, it was during the intermission) world in which the worst problem was that our President had sex with someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s also a <a href='http://www.hulu.com/watch/270883' target='_blank'>bit</a> where Tim Meadows sings a song about using Kwanzaa to convince women to sleep with him, featuring Vanessa Williams as one of his backup singers. She was there to perform with Pavarotti (yeah) in the episode&#039;s musical number, so I can only assume they got her into this sketch by making her think the stage was on the way to the bathroom or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, yes, this is the episode with the <a href='http://www.hulu.com/watch/4156' target='_blank'>Schweddy Balls</a> bit. It&#039;s a dumb joke, and they pad it out to a comfortable five minutes and forty seconds, but the three performers (Baldwin along with Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon) deliver it all so sincerely and the audience is so into it I can&#039;t help but be just a teensy bit entertained despite myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC seems to have a very revisionist history attitude about sharing the archive of Saturday Night live. Seasons 6 - 29 are nowhere to be seen, and the seasons that are available are heavily edited (which makes it tough for idiots like me to make fun of it let me tell you). However, you can catch a handful of sketches from this episode on NBC&#039;s <a href='https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-24/episode/9-alec-baldwin-with-luciano-pavarotti-62981' target='_blank'>website</a> or <a href='http://www.hulu.com/search?q=saturday+night+live+date%3A12%2F12%2F1998' target='_blank'>Hulu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>If the Holidays are all about getting nice and cozy, consider wrapping yourself up in the warm, fluffy blanket that is remembering how great the late 90&#039;s were. Come for the Schweddy Balls (sorry), and stay for getting to see John Goodman hilariously drunk in two different scenes (the scenes were scripted, but I&#039;m pretty sure his inebriation was real).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, speaking of John Goodman . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

This is one of the greatest TV shows ever made, and this is one of the best episodes of it. Go enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, maybe I&#039;ll go on and on a little bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Pizza delivery boy and loser Philip Fry is accidentally cryogenically frozen as the world rings in the year 2000, to be woken up 1000 years later, in wacky, hyper-futuristic New New York. Once there, he befriends a robot, falls in love with a cyclops, and works for a mad scientist&#039;s interstellar delivery company (along with a Jamaican beauracrat and an incompetent lobster creature). Futurama came from The Simpson&#039;s creator Matt Groening (among some other really brilliant writers and producers). It was canceled by Fox after four glorious seasons, only to return on Comedy Central for another few seasons which were actually also pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cartoon about the year 3000 is predictably mostly about world-building, and the world that Futurama shows us is a perfect blend of delightfully colorful, hilariously irreverent, and surprisingly real. Archaic outsider Fry serves as your proxy, so you discover the wackiness of the 31st century through his eyes. You lose yourself in that world to the extent that you won&#039;t even notice the deeply human and incredibly moving stories that the writers occasionally sneak in to sucker-punch you with. Also there&#039;s a sociopathic robot who is fueled by alcohol and chain-smokes cigars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sci-fi has the incredible ability to cast a light on modern day and put society in harsh perspective, and Futurama exploits that ability to great effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the Episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/futurama-xmas.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>We have to wait until the second season to get a Christmas episode, because Futurama&#039;s first season started as a mid-season replacement. Interestingly, that means that 'Xmas Story' was the last episode aired before the monumental new-year&#039;s celebration of the show&#039;s pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much has changed between now and the year 3000, and Christmas (simply referred to in the 31st century as 'Xmas') is no exception. Fry must navigate the wild and, as it turns out, incredibly dangerous new holiday, with hilarious results. They manage to pack a lot of stuff into 22 minutes, including more genuinely hilarious moments than anything else on this list (with one possible exception), an impromptu musical number, and an evil robotic Santa Claus played by John Goodman (sober this time, presumably).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a perfect example of classic Futurama. The writers were still exploring the crazy world, and there&#039;s nothing more exciting than a creative team mining a newly discovered, incredibly rich vein of comedy. The writers do such a great job making essentially 20 minutes of exposition and setup not feel like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve probably watched this episode more than any other on this list, and I still had a great time watching it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Catch the entire series on Netflix, or you can buy Futurama <a href='http://amzn.to/2h0qCln' target='_blank'>Season 2 on DVD</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/futurama-xmas-2.jpg' />\r\n<div class='caption'>Truly a timeless classic show.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Futurama had a few other Xmas episodes, and they&#039;re all pretty great, but I think the first one is the most classic. With all of the exposition of this first episode out of the way, they were free to have more wacky adventures in later years. However, I think building that world in the first place is where the show really excelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, this one has that really great 'Gift of the Magi' bit toward the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the Gift of the Magi . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

I definitely can&#039;t tell you how accurate a portrayal <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> is of 1870&#039;s life, but I can tell you that it was a pretty delightful show. I remember that Little House was on the TV pretty regularly when I was a kid, but I can&#039;t see young me ever watching it by choice (what with there being absolutely no chances of Simpsons references anywhere). Now that I&#039;ve re-watched it as an adult, though, If I saw it on TV now I think I probably would tune in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Loosely based on a best-selling autobiographical book series, <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> is about a frontier family living in a, well, little house on a prairie in the late 1800&#039;s. The show documented the daily lives of the Ingalls family, made up of Laura (the original books&#039; author), her two sisters, and her mother and father (played by Michael Landon of Bonanza fame). The Ingallses lived on the wild frontier of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and were the nicest people in a small community of just the nicest people. Mostly the show is about being nice, which I have to tell you is pretty, well, nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s just take a moment to acknowledge what a cool dude Michael Landon must have been. Landon, pretty fresh from the cancellation of Bonanza just a year earlier, was asked to direct the first episode of Little House and only did it on the condition that he could play the father. The dude parlayed a simple job offer into a successful eight year gig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I do remember watching this show when I was a kid, so stuff like the theme song and opening sequence (which I found pretty hilarious even as a kid) were buried deep in my memories somewhere. It was nice feeling those pleasant memories bubbling up again as I watched this episode. If there&#039;s ever a time for nostalgic swill, it&#039;s the Holiday Season, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is this episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest tropes of the Holiday Story is O&#039;Henry&#039;s classic short story 'The Gift of the Magi.' In the story (just in case you haven&#039;t heard of it), a young woman sells her hair to buy her new husband a nice, gold watch fob, only to find that he sold his late grandfather&#039;s watch to buy her some fancy combs for her hair. It&#039;s a powerful sentiment, for sure. The idea of making a huge sacrifice for someone only to learn that their sacrifice for you rendered yours irrelevant is just the right amount of tragedy to make you say 'aww' without necessarily ruining anybody&#039;s life. It&#039;s a tale that has been referenced, satirized, or otherwise recreated numerous times over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#039;t mean to spoil anything about this episode of <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, but their version of the Gift of the Magi is quite possibly the quintessential one. I don&#039;t see it as a spoiler, because knowing that the surprise is coming at the end makes the episode even more endearing. It is really a heartwarming idea - probably even more-so than any other on this list - that Christmas is all about doing whatever it takes (even letting the spoiled rich kid win) to get the person you love the perfect gift. No sacrifice is too great for the members of this family, and that&#039;s just about the most straightforward 'true meaning of Christmas' that you can have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also get this list&#039;s first official explanation of the Nativity story, from Landon himself, perhaps the only discussion of Santa climbing down a chimney that is actively in use, and a pretty adorable little girl screaming 'Happy Birthday, Jesus.' This Minnesota prairie might be freezing (which the characters repeatedly point out, just in case the low-budget sets don&#039;t convey it well enough), but they sure are good at keeping your heart nice and warm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little House on the Prairie is all about stepping into a simpler time, and this simple interpretation of the small family Christmas is wonderfully refreshing. I can&#039;t recommend it enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s probably still in syndication somewhere, but you can get just <a href='http://amzn.to/2gvJQ18' target='_blank'>this episode</a> or the <a href='http://amzn.to/2gvOXia' target='_blank'>whole first season</a> on DVD. The best deal is probably to <a href='http://amzn.to/2gJjFBQ' target='_blank'> buy it</a> on Amazon streaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/littlehouse.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p><em>Little House on the Prairie</em> was around for a pretty long time. It was still pretty regularly on TV when I was a kid, even though it was entirely made before I was born. I remembered it fondly, and I&#039;m happy to say that upon revisiting it as an adult, it seems to still hold up pretty well. I might even dive in and watch more of it just for fun, and I bet this episode becomes a regular part of my annual Holiday tradition from now on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know the show changes quite a bit through the years, as I guess everybody adopts like a hundred kids (my memory is a bit shady on the details). Also, the later seasons get bogged down a bit with Laura&#039;s relationship with some much older guy, played by dude-with-awesome-name Linwood Boomer. This first season sees the show at its simplest, and the simple life is, after all, what the show was all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, speaking of Linwood Boomer . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

I have always found it an interesting factoid, though, that the love interest from <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> went on to create <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>. Comparing these two shows is actually kind of an interesting juxtaposition. From a nice family of mostly girls we come to this rather awful family of mostly boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>American teen Malcolm [last name withheld] navigates the trials of modern adolescence while dealing with his extremely dysfunctional family and status as a legitimate genius and social outcast. The show is named after him, but really it&#039;s about his whole family. His mother, Lois, leads the family with a notoriously heavy hand, while his father Hal is a lovable goofball. Malcolm shares a room (and even a bed) with two of his brothers, the miscreant bully Reese and the strange but creative Dewey. The oldest brother, Francis, was shipped off to Military School, which has done little to soften his rebellious tendencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ll just be blunt: I love this show. The characters are all nuanced and interesting, the writing is absolutely top-notch, and the stories - especially as the show goes on - are original and creative. Not a day goes by in which I don&#039;t find a parallel between everyday life and something that happens on <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>. It has been ten years since the show was aired, and it still feels just as relevant and modern as it ever has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps more incredible than the fact that the show still stands up extremely well is just how universal it is. When it first aired, I identified strongly with the boys, being an outcast myself, and connected with their struggle against society and overbearing adults who wanted to control their lives. Now that I&#039;m an adult, I find that the tables have turned, and I see the show now as a sad but painfully relevant tale of a father struggling to maintain his fragile sanity and powerless in the face of the endless march of societal obligations. It&#039;s as much about Malcolm as it is about Hal, Lois, Dewey, Reese, or Francis, and each character fits neatly into a different but equally poignant niche. Ultimately the show isn&#039;t just about one kid or even one family - it&#039;s about everyone. It&#039;s about all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, as long as you&#039;re a middle-class white suburban family, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come for Bryan Cranston at his absolute best (sorry <em>Breaking Bad</em> fans), stay for the ensemble cast of people who are so great that Cranston doesn&#039;t even stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Gift of the Magi</em> is a pretty popular Christmas Trope, but the 'True Meaning of Christmas' is the far more common tale. That&#039;s what we get in this third season episode of Malcolm. Being this far into the series, the characters are all very firmly established, so we can see how the classic family Christmas bends to them, instead of the other way around. It isn&#039;t the quintessential episode of the show, but it isn&#039;t the worst, and it&#039;s definitely a unique gem on this list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boys make a mess of the Christmas decorations (as they are wont to do), and Lois does more than threaten to take the entire holiday away (she in fact locks everything away in the garage). She vows to only return the festivities if the boys behave. They respond in their usual way, at first trying to acquiesce but eventually falling back on the rebellion that obviously comes more naturally to them all. Meanwhile Francis is in Canada visiting Lois&#039; evil mother (played by the always brilliant Cloris Leachman), and a battle of wills ensues as they compete to make each other more miserable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story&#039;s conclusion is pretty heartwarming, especially for <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>. It&#039;s one of a few episodes of this show where we get to see how deep these characters go. They aren&#039;t simply nasty hooligans, they&#039;re a real family trying to enjoy the holiday just like the rest of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One downside to this episode is that Hal is uncharacteristically flat, forced into the 'dad' role in the family Christmas, so you&#039;ll miss out on Bryan Cranston going full Bryan Cranston. You can hardly blame him, though, having to compete with the unstoppable forces of Jane Kaczmarek and Cloris Leachman</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole series is just waiting for you to binge watch the entire thing on Netflix.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What do you need to know?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The character with the biggest arc of the entire show is the oldest brother Francis. When the show starts, he is in Military School, but the second season ended with him emancipating himself and running off to work on a logging camp in Alaska (which is where he is in this episode). You have to respect a show that is willing to just completely re-write an entire character&#039;s setting every couple seasons. Oh, also, each episode starts with a cold open that has nothing to do with the rest of the episode, another thing that I wish more shows would do.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Consider that this episode came out in 2001, which I think we can all agree was a rather bad year. People probably felt like throwing everything away and giving up, tossing whatever joy and excitement was left into the garage. I don&#039;t know if the producers of MitM were trying to create anything more than just a funny half hour of TV escapism, but I think it&#039;s especially poignant (and relevant today) when viewed in that context. Sometimes when everything sucks we just have to take a deep breath, let go of the fury and the frustration, and just have a good time anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, actually, while we&#039;re on the subject of Cloris Leechman. . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

Since this show aired after 2008 or so, I never had a chance (no pun intended) to actually catch it on TV, but thanks to Netflix we can all enjoy this gem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Jimmy Chance is a young man with few resources and even fewer chances - er, prospects. When he becomes a father after a one-night stand with a strange woman (who ends up being a murderer), he decides to turn his life around and learn some responsibility. He and his new daughter live with his young parents Burt - who runs a middling landscaping company - and Virginia - who works for an in-home maid service. Also in the house is Virginia&#039;s completely senile grandmother (played by the still genius Cloris Leachman). Jimmy finds a job at the local grocery store, where he predictably finds his love interest Sabrina, who just as predictably has an out-of-town boyfriend. They all do their best to make ends meet and give baby Hope (yes, they call her Hope Chance) the best life they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where this show leaves other 'Quirky Family' sitcoms behind is how irresistibly endearing all of the characters are. Burt is a screw-up and a failure, Virginia is an opinionated blow-hard (and hoarder) who cleans toilets for a living, Jimmy is a complete doofus and regularly deemed an accident, and the rarely lucid Maw-Maw clearly needs professional care. By all rights, they should be miserable (and us, the audience, with them), and yet the show is delightful to watch. Burt and Virginia adore each other, Jimmy is full of childlike innocence, and Maw-maw is hilarious (even though sometimes her character goes a little overboard). This show isn&#039;t just an example of skirting that line between making characters endearing and making them pitiable - it&#039;s a master class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come for watching Cloris Leachman off her rocker, stay for Martha Plimpton&#039;s ability to hilariously mispronounce words. Actually, I could have written this entire thing about how great Martha Plimpton is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the Episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>'Toy Story' is an example of the show at its best. We see Virginia on a crusade to leverage her new granddaughter for social glory (but with the best of intentions), and her almost Machiavellian attempts to manipulate everyone to get her way (she really does mean well, though). We see Burt perpetrating a scheme to make some extra money over the holiday season, and we see Jimmy doing his best to give Hope everything he missed out on as a child. We also see Cloris Leachman in a Joseph costume, which is a highlight of this list for sure. It all culminates in a grand climax (and a pretty great joke that always gets me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a low-stakes romp, and a light-hearted 22 minutes. Other shows might promise a deeper emotional core, more peril, or grander caliber of humor, but few shows can match this one&#039;s level of innocent delight. <em>Raising Hope</em> goes down smooth and gently, like a glass of mulled wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch the whole show on Netflix, or buy the first season on <a href='http://amzn.to/2gZ8R32' target='_blank'>DVD</a> or <a href='http://amzn.to/2h7TtAn' target='_blank'>streaming</a> from Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>In the world of Sitcom, with the soft, bright lighting and straightforward musical cues, everything always goes well in the end. Most sitcoms have a grasp of that concept. In 22 minutes, everything should be tied up in a nice, happy little bow, and the good guys always win. What <em>Raising Hope</em> remembers that other sitcoms seem to forget is making sure to create a family of good guys who you genuinely want to see win. It&#039;s not enough to have hope, you have to have charm, too - and <em>Raising Hope</em> has more than enough of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the creators of <em>Raising Hope</em> had been around the block before . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

Apparently it was pretty okay. I do remember watching it in syndication (probably during some after school period where there was absolutely nothing else to watch), but I barely remember it at all. I have read the Wikipedia page about it, and I still probably can&#039;t really tell you what it&#039;s about. The 'quirky b-list comedian and his disproportionately attractive wife' show is as common as it is devoid of substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in 2005 Garcia brought My Name is Earl to the world. NBC (and the &#039;08 - &#039;09 writers strike) didn&#039;t handle the show terribly well as time went on, but the first couple seasons are pretty solid gold. He then went on to create Raising Hope, which was also great - but I&#039;ve already talked about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ll let Earl himself describe the show, using the voiceover that plays during pretty much every episode&#039;s opener: 'You know the kind of guy who does nothing but bad things and then wonders why his life sucks? Well, that was me. Every time something good happened to me, something bad was always waiting around the corner: karma. That&#039;s when I realized that I had to change, so I made a list of everything bad I&#039;ve ever done and one by one I&#039;m gonna make up for all my mistakes. I&#039;m just trying to be a better person. My name is Earl.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the show does really well is crafting the world of fictional Camden County, where the show is set. It&#039;s a rich tapestry of characters, and it is generally used very effectively. The format of the show allowed the creators to really clearly establish a new aspect of this world, and then it became part of their tool belt to refer back to later. As Earl helps more people, the show&#039;s stable of characters who show up later gets bigger. Very rarely is a character in only one episode - even the minor ones, which is a sort of thing you rarely see outside of something like the Simpsons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s also fun just because it&#039;s a departure from the vanilla, suburban wasteland that is so common in the TV sitcom. We see the scummy, seedy underbelly of society - the dirt bags and scoundrels who would normally cause you to quickly walk the other way if you saw them on the street. Just like Raising Hope, though, it portrays these people with such depth and humanity that you want to root for them. It&#039;s rich, it&#039;s colorful, and it&#039;s just as full of that child-like innocence that makes Raising Hope so charming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus it&#039;s just satisfying to be able to live in this world where Karma is a real, tangible thing, and there are people out there actively just trying to make the world better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We get another pretty standard sitcom family Christmas tale here, but the unique flavor of My Name is Earl definitely sets it apart. As Earl&#039;s first Christmas since his quest for redemption began, he is intent on making up for the last several years of holidays that he ruined for his ex-wife, Joy, and her kids. This episode relies pretty heavily on the core cast, albeit with the fantastic addition of guest-stars Blake Clark and Brett Butler as Joy&#039;s parents. In classic My Name is Earl form, much of the episode is told via flashback, comparing reformed Earl to just how much of a scumbag he used to be. As the episode progresses, we learn that Earl isn&#039;t the only one with bad deeds he needs to apologize for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s another episode showing Christmas as a time for secrets and lying to each other. This time it seems that the True Meaning of Christmas is to maintain those white lies that we tell ourselves. We all have problems, and we certainly all have things we&#039;d love to leave behind us. There comes a time when you just need to forget about all that for a bit and just enjoy yourself and your family.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole series (including the tumultuous third season and the cliffhanger ending that will probably never be resolved) is available on Netflix, or you can buy the first season on Amazon on <a href='http://amzn.to/2g6BKgM' target='_blank'>DVD</a> or <a href=' http://amzn.to/2gZJLRd' target='_blank'>streaming</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What do you need to know?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Earl has such a rich world, it might be hard to jump in the middle without at least a primer on all of the main characters. You have Earl and his brother Randy, who is his loyal sidekick. Their good friend is Catalina, the maid in the motel where they live. Joy (Jaime Pressly) is Earl&#039;s ex-wife, who left him for Darnell, who works at the local crab shack (Earl calls him 'crab man'). It also happens that Darnell is the father of one of Joy&#039;s sons. Though there was a bit of drama in the beginning, Earl and Joy are still friends (Earl&#039;s eager friendliness is one of the show&#039;s big draws, really), which I suppose is pretty obvious in this episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully that helps clarify things.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>If you live in a family sitcom, it seems that the simple act of watching children open Christmas presents is enough to solve any problems. Whether or not you agree in reality, it&#039;s perfectly serviceable trope in the world of TV. Like the friendly neighbor or the b-list comedian with the hot wife, it&#039;s just something that happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it would be nice if we could take a break from all that for a bit . . .</p>\r\n",

I guess I did a lot of TV watching in High School and College. I can try to justify it by saying it was a very good time in Television, with a lot of really original and awesome shows. However, I suspect that I just remember it best because it was the most recent era during which I actually watched any TV. I couldn&#039;t even tell you what&#039;s on any of the major networks these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, here&#039;s another selection from the mid 2000&#039;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Liz Lemon is the head writer for a mediocre late night sketch variety show on NBC. It is to some degree an autobiography about Tina Fey&#039;s time on Saturday Night Live (which we already covered), and it also stars frequent SNL host Alec Baldwin (who we already covered). I think the show is more 'inspired by' than 'based on' in terms of biographical accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The action mostly comes from and revolves around the cast of off-the-wall characters. First, we have Liz Lemon herself, the food obsessed, socially inept, eternally frustrated main character. She has to constantly babysit her staff, including the certifiably insane stars Tracy and Jenna, the team of trouble making writers, and a bible-thumping NBC page. Finally we have the full-of-himself executive, Jack Donaghe, who was put in charge of the network in the show&#039;s pilot. Jack takes Liz on as his 'mentee' but really only causes more trouble. Each episode features a smorgasbord of comedy, from the low-brow to the surreal, and I think that&#039;s its greatest strength. It&#039;s somehow cheerful, cynical, self-aware, self-referential, irreverent, low-brow, high-brow, nerdy, intellectual, stupid, silly, and serious all at once. I don&#039;t think any other show can match it in terms of variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know it&#039;s yet another show from NBC&#039;s mid 2000 prime time, but I still think it&#039;s a departure from the smooth gentility of the last few items in the list. It&#039;s a wild ride, and often feels as frazzled as its main character. You should watch the show if only to catch the occasional cameo by Me-Look-Alike (and former Simpsons writer) Conan O&#039;Brien.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The holiday break is approaching, and the cast of TGS (the show within a show that 30 Rock is about) is anxiously awaiting the annual tradition of 'Ludachristmas' - a debauchery-filled party that is notoriously and purposefully out of control. Meanwhile, Liz&#039;s family is in town on their annual visit. Meanwhile, meanwhile, Kenneth the page is distraught at the cast&#039;s impending debauchery and stages an intervention to teach them all the true meaning of Christmas (which mostly involves being really bored). Meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile, Jack&#039;s overbearing mother is in town, which is always an endless source of stress on him. Meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile wild man Tracy is forced to wear a court-ordered ankle bracelet which will notify the authorities if he has any alcohol in his system. Meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile Liz&#039;s brother suffers from brain damage which has caused him to constantly think that he is still a high-school student in the early 80&#039;s who is about to go on the skiing trip at which he had the accident which damaged his brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see what I meant by 'wild ride?' Somehow they pack all this into 22 minutes, and still find time for some pretty hilarious moments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I promised a story that didn&#039;t involve the main characters learning the true meaning of Christmas by watching children open presents, and basically that exact thing happens in this episode. However, I think the irreverent way in which this show handles that clich&eacute; plot device is worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Say what you will about all these shows from the 2000&#039;s, but at least they&#039;re all on Netflix and available for purchase from Amazon on <a href='http://amzn.to/2gc4DrJ' target='_blank'>DVD</a> or <a href='http://amzn.to/2h7uFvT' target='_blank'>streaming</a>. Actually, that&#039;s probably a better reason as to why I&#039;m so familiar with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>I realize 30 Rock probably isn&#039;t for everybody. It&#039;s too fast paced and frantic, and the humor can probably come off pretty pretentious, as if to say that if you don&#039;t get it, it&#039;s because you just aren&#039;t cool enough. Hopefully there&#039;s enough on this list for everybody, and you&#039;ll find something else that you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe when you hear someone mention 30 Rock you think they actually meant a different show, from about ten years earlier . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

Just think of all the amazing talent we&#039;ve seen so far. Jane Kaczmarek, Martha Plimpton, Alec Baldwin (twice), John Goodman, Bryan Cranston - I could go on and on. In fact, I&#039;m going to start having a hard time coming up with new ways to say 'the cast of this show is pretty good.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However - at least in my opinion - no other show on this list comes close to 3rd Rock from the Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>No, seriously, this show is as close to perfect as I think we might ever see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Lithgow overacts to such a delightful extreme, never once dropping the intensity for a second. Jane Curtin is indisputably in the all time upper echelon of comedic performers. Kristen Johnston is magnificent at every turn. French Stewart is like every classic comedian, from Buster Keaton to the Marx Brothers all rolled into one. Baby Joseph Gordon-Levitt was showing us all the incredible talent that people are only just starting to appreciate twenty years later. This is just scratching the surface. If any one of these actors were at this level of brilliance in any other show, they would be unforgettable (in fact, they&#039;ve all pretty much done exactly that). Here, they&#039;re just part of the cast, and they drive each other to be even greater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, <strong>What is the show?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Solomon family might seem like a pretty wacky group, but there&#039;s a reason for that - they&#039;re all aliens. They arrive on Earth in the first episode, assuming the appearance of four perfectly generic Humans. They live just outside Cleveland in fictional Rutherford, Ohio, to study this insignificant little blue speck and the strange creatures that inhabit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 'High Commander' of the group, blowhard to end all blowhards Dick (played by Lithgow) assumes the mantle of a Physics professor at a third-rate community college. His lieutenant and head of security becomes Sally (Johnston), a six foot tall amazon woman who regularly breaks hearts as well as limbs. The information officer (and oldest member of the group) assumes the form of a teenage boy, Tommy (Gordon-Levitt), which is - as you can imagine - wrought with peril. Finally, the group&#039;s communication officer becomes Harry (Stewart), a goofy soul with a few screws loose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that doesn&#039;t sound like the most spectacular premise for a show, I don&#039;t know what is. It is only helped by the fact that the writing is every bit as good as the cast. The way that Dick approaches every situation like a child - with all the stubborn, selfish, naivety that you would expect - is just delightful to watch. They get sick, they fall in love, they fight, they get in trouble, they laugh, they learn, and they do it in such a wonderfully silly way. It loses some of its charm and perfection as the novelty of the whole thing wore off a little bit in the later seasons, but even at its worst 3rd Rock from the Sun is better than pretty much anything else out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come for the fact that I am telling you seriously this is the greatest show ever made, and stay for the great costumes, the great sets, the unrelenting comedic pacing, John Lithgow shouting 'meeee,' the 90&#039;s charm, and the fact that it genuinely is one of the pinnacles of the craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The family of aliens experiences their first Christmas. In the classic show form, the four main characters each go off and have their own misadventures around the central theme. The writers treated the first couple seasons like a sketch show, focusing on individual scenes more than the whole episode, and it shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we have possibly the purest 'true meaning of Christmas' story on the list, as four aliens strive to answer the simple question, 'no, really, what is Christmas?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, why delay any further? I need to stop going off the deep-end for this show, and you need to start watching it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Like usual, it&#039;s on Netflix and the DVDs are on Amazon (don&#039;t even waste your time, you want the <a href='http://amzn.to/2h8C9vI' target='_blank'>whole series</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What do you need to know?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah, there is one detail to point out. Dick&#039;s primary quest in the series is to win the heart of Mary Albright (Jane Curtin&#039;s character), another professor at the school and his office-mate. At this point in the series, they are dating (at least, as much as an Alien who has been Human for not even a year could date). That&#039;s why she is a bit more affectionate toward him in this episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>I know I am gushing pretty hard on this show. It&#039;s right up my alley and completely satisfies everything I could ever want in a show. Can you blame me for embellishing just a little bit? It&#039;s really a great show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Dick learns in this episode, Christmas is the time to give people incredible gifts, and I&#039;m giving you the greatest gift of all: 3rd Rock from the Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, on the subject of people giving extravagant gifts . . .</p>\r\n",

She isn&#039;t that interested in most sitcoms, which is almost as disappointing as the fact that she has no interest at all in watching Star Trek. At least we have <em>The Office</em>, which she will watch at any time, regardless of how many times she&#039;s watched it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>An American remake / adaptation of the BBC show of the same name, <em>The Office</em> showcases the daily lives of a paper company district branch in Eastern Pennsylvania, mockumentary style. Initially the show is  an examination of the socially inept branch manager Michael Scott (played definitively by Steve Carrell), but the viewer quickly discovers that the office depicted in <em>The Office</em> is full of equally eccentric characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we get is a pretty authentic-feeling slice of office life. The sad reality (that anyone who has worked in an office would probably agree on) is that the show&#039;s writers don&#039;t really need to exaggerate things  much to find entertainment. From squabbles over break room resources to the awkward (and painfully useless) company meetings, <em>The Office</em> has a lot of material to draw from. The documentary style and the down-to-earth setting lead to a sense of awkwardness and discomfort so thick you could cut it with a knife, which could put off some viewers. Those who power through (or find the entertainment in) those tense moments will find a lot of rewards to reap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think what made <em>The Office</em> successful (and ultimately a powerhouse of prime time television) was the ensemble nature of the show. The main cast are all heavily invested in it, serving as producers, writers, and directors on many episodes. This causes all of the characters to be that much more rich, as the actors who play them are able to sculpt them directly as the show goes on. Most of the cast is made up of perennial background players - I&#039;ve seen most if not all of them show up in a lot of other shows as 'guy at counter' or 'lady with newspaper' type roles - and they sink their teeth into their office roles with such voracity that their eagerness and sense of fun is almost as palpable as the awkward tension.  Of course, the story lines and relationship drama is very compelling, too, but what I like about the show is just how much fun everybody is clearly having (and I definitely appreciate the irony of that, given the setting).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Office</em> is an onion, and each layer you peel away reveals another just as juicy and savory as the one before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Office</em> draws heavily on its real-world setting, and few things are more clich&eacute; in an American office than the Christmas Party. In fact, I would say that the Christmas episodes of the Office became pretty legendary, becoming almost special events each year. I think that success stems directly from this, the series&#039; first such episode. If you have never seen <em>The Office</em> before - I&#039;m glad you got out of the fallout shelter - this is a great episode to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being early in the show (the first season was only a few episodes, directly remade from the British version, so the second is really where the American show took off on its own), this episode is entirely driven by Michael&#039;s misguided bumbling. In classic <em>The Office</em> form, Michael&#039;s efforts to win everybody over and come off like a great boss and friend only makes everybody mad and threatens to ruin everything. Buying an iPod for a $25 Secret Santa exchange is Michael in a nutshell, and the rest of the cast is well on their way to finding their own nutshells, too. The layers are as deep in this episode as any other in the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled for the Homer Simpson doll, too . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, the show is on Netflix, and the <a href='http://amzn.to/2gsiJ6M' target='_blank'>Streaming</a> and the <a href='http://amzn.to/2hez51K' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> are on Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>I think <em>The Office</em> is a very rare show that will stand on its own forever. Other shows have tried to replicate the style and success, but they have all missed the secret sauce that made <em>The Office</em> <em>The Office</em> - reality. The cast wasn&#039;t just reading a script and playing a bunch of characters, they were the characters. It might be awkward at times, but only because it&#039;s so relatable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It remained so, too . . .</p>\r\n",

I&#039;m in Chicago this weekend, so I&#039;m too busy eating pizza to spend too much time writing about how much I love some show for being about robots and/or aliens. Moreover, jumping ahead four years is a pretty interesting juxtaposition in itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>See yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will add that the show evolved quite a bit over the years. Things got a little silly at times, and we had the usual sitcom cycle of wedding and baby episodes. However, <em>The Office</em> did a reasonably good job sticking with what worked - which is another side effect of the overlap between on- and off-screen talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. What&#039;s interesting is how the show evolved from being about Michael&#039;s bumbling leadership to being about all of the crazy dynamics between all of the other characters. Michael&#039;s social ineptitude became the foundation around which the rest of the cast navigated. Much like the real world, everybody figured out how to work with Michael (perhaps in spite of him), which then became a sort of challenge for him to keep making things difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the show wore on, the creators knew the whole 'bumbling, incompetent boob' shtick would only carry the show so far. We began to see that Michael wasn&#039;t completely incompetent, and his clueless-ness actually made him a pretty skilled salesman and manager. By this point in the show, Dunder Mifflin - the company everybody worked for - was basically in financial ruin, and yet our heroes in the Scranton branch were still successful. The show runners locked down the real secret to lasting, successful characters. They weren&#039;t simple, one-note archetypes - they were nuanced, three-dimensional, and had actual skills to go along with their shortcomings. People being comically bad at something might be funny for a Three Stooges routine, but it won&#039;t sustain a TV show for six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this episode, Michael gets jealous of Phyllis being given the opportunity to be Santa this year. 'Phyllis has uslurped my role,' he says, in classic Michael form. We also get a completely different take on Secret Santa, as the writers very wisely didn&#039;t rehash jokes from their first Christmas episode. The Jim / Pam romance from earlier in the series is replace (or perhaps uslurped) by Andy and Erin, who had been introduced in the intervening years, by the way. We also get a company-wide crisis and panic, which is a great setting for all of the characters to showcase their individual brands of crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s another great episode of a great show. As you watch, in the scene early on where Kevin sits on Michael&#039;s (dressed as Santa) lap, keep your eyes on Mindy Kaling, in the background, as she tries not to laugh. Four years later, everybody is still just having fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s still on Netflix, and the <a href='http://amzn.to/2giNSGE' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> and <a href='http://amzn.to/2gkWGRj' target='_blank'>Streaming</a> options are still on Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Here we see an example of another great Christmas trope - a perfectly normal series of events being labeled a 'Christmas Miracle!' In this case, it&#039;s attributed to a recurring theme on <em>The Office</em>, which is the threat of everybody being fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it isn&#039;t the only show depicting everybody almost being fired at the Christmas party . . .</p>\r\n",

However, there&#039;s one show on my list which I think is the absolute pinnacle. Without embellishment, this is probably the best show ever made. 3rd Rock might be my favorite, but I believe that Arrested Development is without equal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bluth family, real estate moguls living large in Newport Beach, California, have fallen on hard times. Rather, hard times have fallen on them. Mirroring real-world corporate meltdowns like Enron, the government has cracked down on the Bluth Corporation and is investigating it for shady dealings. The Paternal head of the company, George Senior, is thrown in jail and his son, actually competent Michael, comes in to try to pick up the pieces and salvage what&#039;s left of the sinking ship. It sounds pretty dry and even a little tedious, but it isn&#039;t. The spiraling chaos that is the Bluth family offers a level of dysfunction and entertainment that is unrivaled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I mention the whole thing is narrated by Ron Howard?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What really sets the show apart (aside from being narrated by Ron Howard) is just the sheer amount of work that was put into it. &#039;Meticulous&#039; doesn&#039;t even come close. Every single detail of the show has a purpose - everything (I mean down to random background props) has a story to tell and a joke to deliver. Intricate, complicated jokes are carefully built up and established, only to pay off later, sometimes numerous episodes later. Every single frame is packed with visual gags, references, callbacks, or other juicy tidbits. It&#039;s only after the second, third, or even fourth viewing that you can really appreciate it. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve watched the entire series, and I will still find new jokes that I&#039;ve never noticed before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a show ahead of its time. I&#039;m pretty sure it was a pioneer of the single-camera, continuous format TV series. It uses the episodic format as a comic device (each episode ends with a series of joke 'next time' clips), but ultimately it&#039;s one continuous, incredible story from the first episode to the last. It&#039;s a show that&#039;s meant to be binged, and it came out unfortunately just before that was a thing. Low ratings and general lack of interest slowly choked it into cancellation in 2006, but it has found a renewed life on Netflix, both figuratively and literally. That is its natural habitat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spoken highly about shows on this list already. However, make no mistake about this one: Arrested Development is a masterpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a continuous format show, it&#039;s hard to just drop in right in the middle without a lot of context. The fact is that if you haven&#039;t watched this show before, you should just go ahead and start from the beginning anyway, because it&#039;s worth every single second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bluth Company (or what&#039;s left of it at this point) is getting ready for the annual Christmas party, and trying to ignore the current boss and oldest son of the Bluth family, GOB. GOB is excited about the annual tradition of 'toasting' the boss, even though he clearly can&#039;t take a joke and immediately fires everybody. Michael, trying to distract himself from the fact that he wasn&#039;t chosen to be the boss in his father&#039;s absence, tries to spend time with his son, George-Michael, but it turns out George-Michael would rather spend Christmas with his girlfriend and her hardcore Christian family. Meanwhile, Lucille, the family&#039;s regularly drunk Matriarch, deals with the stress of having her husband a fugitive (oh yeah, George escaped from prison and is hiding in the attic - it totally makes sense if you watch it). Buster, the youngest son, runs off to Army, only to be distracted by a claw machine. Lindsay, Michael&#039;s twin sister, tries to distract herself from her crazy husband who is stuck at home because Lucille deafened him when he went to her apartment dressed like a Blue Man . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ugh, this show is hard to sum up. Let&#039;s just say that this episode, right in the middle of the series, is quite possibly the perfect Arrested Development episode. It is a tangled web of insanity, which unravels delightfully in the episode&#039;s climax (featuring Will Arnett in a giant banana costume). It features some of my favorite jokes from the whole series, some of which I will reference to this day. Actually, if I were going to pick my favorite episode of the show, I might just pick this one - the fact that it&#039;s a Christmas episode is just a bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, keep your eyes peeled for the cameo by a Bart Simpson doll . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This show is, like I said, meant to be binged. Head to Netflix, or buy the <a href='http://amzn.to/2hcNPO3' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> or <a href='http://amzn.to/2gtI6VN' target='_blank'>episodes</a> on Amazon and get ready to settle in for the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Lightning doesn&#039;t strike twice, of course, and the fourth season produced for Netflix just doesn&#039;t live up to the first three. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s okay - it just isn&#039;t the same. It&#039;s like hanging out with your college friends a few years after you left. It feels the same, but there&#039;s some spark missing. The magic is gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, Will Arnett in a giant banana costume reminds me of some other wacky Christmas costumes . . .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It was at the height of its impact when I was in school, at a time in my life when the show&#039;s title felt just a teensy bit like it was mocking me. I remember people talking about what happened in the show at school (as I was listening from afar and wondering why they weren&#039;t talking to me). The show was a weekly lesson in what would be the new cool inside joke or social trend. I don&#039;t really remember what the big deal was (and the title still stings just a little). I don&#039;t want to dig into it and dissect what led to such a winning mainstay in our society (mostly because I would rather not revisit that particular period of my personal history). What I will do is talk about one episode that I do remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wonder what show about stuff I don&#039;t have is popular with the kids in school these days. There&#039;s probably some new show called 'Website Audience.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What was the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Friends follows along with the (incredibly enviable) lives of six young, cool people living in New York City in the late 90&#039;s and early 2000&#039;s. We follow along as they go about their lives, having the sort of fun misadventures that most people living in big cities could only dream of (I know that from experience). They hang out in the coffee shop, they hang out in their incredible, spacious apartments, and they very occasionally go to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#039;s really all there is to it. There are no aliens or robots, and nobody is labeled 'dysfunctional,' so as you might imagine it isn&#039;t one of my favorite shows (judgmental title aside). Of course, the way it depicts a group of 20-somethings just hanging out all the time and barely working in one of the most expensive cities in the world is kind of science fiction in itself. Just because it isn&#039;t my favorite doesn&#039;t mean I can&#039;t find stuff to like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think two things really make the show successful. First (and probably most blatantly), the show doesn&#039;t just show you this group of friends having their good times. The reason my schoolmates (and most of America along with them) were so drawn to the show was that it makes you feel like one of the friends. You are just hanging out with them, joining in their inside jokes and laughing along with them (instead of just listening in from afar wondering why they aren&#039;t talking to you). The TV Moguls have tried to replicate this formula with similar 'group of cool people' type shows, but they&#039;ve never really managed to pull it off quite the same way. I think that is in no small part due to the other big success of Friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friends is actually really well written. They created a show about six cool people, and in most episodes most of those six people have their own little adventure throughout the show. The way in which the writers manage to weave these different adventures together is what really makes the show great. Why would we watch a show about people with much better lives than us, unless that show was, entirely on its own, pretty fun to watch? As people have tried to replicate Friends over the years, they always seem to forget that one factor that actually made it successful. You can&#039;t just depict cool people living awesome lives - the show has to actually be good, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a Ross heavy episode, which might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you <a href='/assets/images/advent2016/friends_futurama.png' target='_blank'>feel about Ross</a>. Here we find him fretting because he has his son (who he has custody of whenever it suits an episode&#039;s plot) for Christmas this year, and he wants to make sure that young Ben has an appreciation for Hanukkah, since Ross is Jewish. Ben is immediately not receptive to the idea, which leads to Ross making a predictable spate of Bad Sitcom Choices. Meanwhile Chandler and Monica are celebrating their first Christmas as an engaged couple, which is something to be celebrated (I know that from experience). Finally, Phoebe worries about whether or not Rachel still wants to live with her, because as we all know when you live in New York you have your choice of tons of really amazing apartments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#039;t watch Friends as religiously as I do some of the other selections on my list, but when I do I usually have the same reaction I had while watching this episode. For maybe two thirds of the time, I&#039;ll think it&#039;s a pretty mediocre show. The storylines are simple and predictable, the characters are all bland (even though the cast is really quite good), and at any given time the stakes are about as low as can be. However, at some point it all clicks and everything comes together. The individual notes, rather flat and lifeless on their own, combine to form an excellent crescendo of melody. The titular scene (led by a sincere and fully committed David Schwimmer) is easily the episode&#039;s highlight, and it starts a cascade of excellent jokes that lead us to the conclusion. As is the case with most episodes of Friends, the first fifteen minutes don&#039;t do much for me, but the last five more than make up for it. It&#039;s like a water slide, but in TV form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, we are finally able to see Hanukkah represented on the list!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It was kind of a big deal that Friends went up on Netflix a couple years ago. I guess people are still pretty excited about it. It&#039;s also, as is the custom, available on Amazon via either <a href='http://amzn.to/2hJkvOD' target='_blank'>DVD</a> or <a href='http://amzn.to/2hJhI8r' target='_blank'>Streaming</a>. I know all that because I was Googling how to find the show. That&#039;s right, I was only looking for how to find Friends, the show - nothing else.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>If I were going to teach a class on Sitcom plot structure, I would probably use quite a few episodes of Friends as the standard by which others are judged. It isn&#039;t the best, it isn&#039;t the worst, but it&#039;s a rock solid example of pacing and story structure from beginning to end. I don&#039;t think my school mates were thinking about things like pacing or describing anything as any kind of 'crescendo,' but you don&#039;t have to understand a compelling TV show to be compelled by it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, while we&#039;re talking about holidays besides Christmas . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "<h5>Seinfeld <br />\r\nSeason 9 Episode 10 <br />\r\n'The Strike'</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally broadcast December 18, 1997</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/seinfeld.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>You probably could have guessed that this episode would come up at some point on the list. Seinfeld is one of the most iconic shows to ever grace the tube, and this episode is one of the more famous ones. You&#039;ve got 'serenity now,' 'high talker,' 'shrinkage,' 'no soup for you,' and many more references to a show from 20 years ago that you are still likely to hear today. but perhaps most iconic of them all is from right here in this very episode - the winter holiday known as Festivus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;ve made this joke already on the list, but you have definitely been in a cave if you haven&#039;t heard of Seinfeld by now. Based on the observational comedy of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, Seinfeld is very famously a 'show about nothing' which served as a social commentary and caricature of society through its seven season run. Seinfeld mostly plays himself, while David is represented by high-functioning psychopath George Costanza. They hang out with Jerry&#039;s ex-girlfriend Elaine, and his across-the-hall neighbor Kramer, who is usually raiding Jerry&#039;s fridge. While on paper the show is about nothing, it&#039;s really about four kind of awful people clawing their way through life, and making light of absolutely everything as they go along.<?p>\r\n\r\n<p>The characters basically embody one of my favorite sayings - 'don&#039;t take life too seriously, you&#039;ll never get out alive.' Nobody ever learns a lesson, nobody ever really wins, and the series literally ends exactly how it began. That&#039;s not the point, though. The point is that life will always go on with or without us, so we might as well have a bit of fun while we&#039;re here. We can&#039;t exactly deny the appeal of that, can we?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching <em>Seinfeld</em> is incredibly fascinating as a time capsule of what life was like in the mid 90&#039;s. Sure, it&#039;s glorified and fictionalized to some degree, but the show succeeds at capturing the essence of the mundane. It happens to be from a pretty cynical viewpoint, perhaps, but there&#039;s nothing less valid about that, and that&#039;s what gives Seinfeld its unique edge. We see life pre-cellphone and pre-internet, which is getting increasingly hard to fathom these days. It might not seem like society has changed much in the last 20 years, but very few episodes of Seinfeld would be the same if the characters all had iPhones in their pockets and Facebook accounts. However, I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing the episode where George accidentally likes a three year old picture of an ex, and the hijinks that ensue as he tries to hide the evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Seinfeld was great even when it was current, and that&#039;s because it follows what I&#039;m now dubbing my One Big Rule - it&#039;s actually a good show. Quite a few people would call it the best, in fact. Since it has no robots or aliens, I just can&#039;t bring myself to be one of those people, but I will openly acknowledge its greatness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s this thing called the 'uncanny valley' when people talk about a representation of a real-world thing. We are so programmed to recognize ourselves and things familiar to us that we can instinctually detect when something is fake. Basically, the more realistic a simulation becomes, the less we actually connect with it - it becomes creepy and unsettling. It&#039;s why a lot of very detailed CG characters look 'off' to us. However, there&#039;s a sweet spot where something can simply be a loose representation - a cartoon or caricature, for example - and we can totally accept it. Compare the human characters in the first <em>Toy Story</em> movie to a much later Pixar movie like <em>The Incredibles</em> - the more 'cartoony' ones actually feel more 'human' to us. The point of all this is that <em>Seinfeld</em> is great because it perfectly threaded that needle. Where something like <em>The Office</em> is right inside that uncomfortable, off-putting valley and <em>Friends</em> is perhaps a bit too far-fetched to be believable, <em>Seinfeld</em> hits the sweet spot. It&#039;s just realistic enough that you can accept it as the 'real world,' and it&#039;s just wacky enough to not make you uncomfortable. It&#039;s deeply relatable, it&#039;s snarky and irreverent while not being just evil and overly narcissistic, and it&#039;s satisfying to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Seinfeld</em> had a few episodes set during the holiday season over the years, but like most things that weren&#039;t cereal or Superman, Jerry and the gang never really cared that much. It wasn&#039;t until the show&#039;s final season that things became unhinged just enough to allow something as wacky as 'The Strike' to slip through. There are moments when you can tell that the cast and crew is getting just a tad out of control. They&#039;re having fun, though, and as I&#039;ve said before when the cast is having fun, so will we.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do get a pretty solid <em>Seinfeld</em> episode here. George gets tangled up in a web of lies to cover up a pretty awful thing he did just to save a few bucks. Jerry gets tangled up in a relationship with a woman who he clearly doesn&#039;t care about at all. Elaine gets tangled up in the consequences of her own stubbornness. Kramer does some crazy stuff. It all culminates in the reveal of Festivus, a holiday made up by George&#039;s father, revolving around some not actually terrible (but deeply traumatizing to poor George) traditions. It&#039;s a classic, and proof that the show was putting out solid hits even into its final year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Cranston makes an appearance, long before he became a dysfunctional father and long, long before he broke bad. Also, also, George&#039;s boss is played by the guy who showed up in the first couple seasons of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> as the head of the Military Academy. We also see Kevin McDonald, from <em>Kids in the Hall</em> fame, playing his usual type-cast 'awkward party guest' role.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Seinfeld is a pretty big win for Hulu, as it&#039;s only available to stream there. Of course, it&#039;s also on <a href='http://amzn.to/2hLM227' target='_blank'>DVD</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the shows on my list, <em>Seinfeld</em> is probably the biggest. No other show is as big of a phenomenon as <em>Seinfeld</em>, and I don&#039;t think any other show will have the staying power. Okay, so there&#039;s probably one show, but we aren&#039;t there yet. The point is that <em>Seinfeld</em> is at least on the podium. It probably accidentally locked someone in a closet in order to claim that spot on the podium, but there it stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it&#039;s nice to see some non-traditional holidays represented on the list. There&#039;s more to see about Jewish people from New York, as well . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "<h5>Northern Exposure <br />\r\nSeason 3 Episode 10 <br />\r\n'Seoul Mates'</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally broadcast December 16, 1991</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/northern_exposure.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up, this was one of my Mom&#039;s favorite shows. She had many (if not all) of the episodes recorded on VHS tapes, carefully catalogued and organized by which episodes were her favorite. I didn&#039;t really get into the show until college, at which point I was able to come across recordings of my own. I think my Mom found a lot of spiritual guidance from the show. That might seem like a strange thing, until you watch it. I think there&#039;s a lot we could all learn from this show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a good departure from Seinfeld, as we now swing back to the 'heartwarming' side of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Joel Fleischman had his entire medical education paid for on one condition, that he commit to a multiple year stint in Alaska after he graduated. Thinking he would end up in relatively civilized Anchorage, he agreed to the deal. The show starts with the young doctor being dragged (almost kicking and screaming) to Cicely instead, a remote little town right in the middle of nowhere. Though he tries to fight it, he is forced to fulfill his obligation and practice as the local doctor for the town&#039;s colorful inhabitants and surrounding populations of Native peoples. Through the course of the show, he slowly grows accustomed to the place, and learns a thing or two about humility, respect, friendliness, and all that sappy stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some shows paint a beautiful, fun, exciting world that you can&#039;t help but want to be a part of, and I can&#039;t really think of any better example than Northern Exposure. It&#039;s a perfect 'fish out of water' story. An uptight, snobby New York Jew is forced to live in a log cabin in the wilderness and interact with the locals who represent really the antithesis of big city life. The cast of characters is as diverse as it is wonderful (which is to say incredibly so). The joy and wonder of the setting (and its inhabitants) makes the main character all the more interesting. He&#039;s portrayed for the most part as a pretty unlikeable person, a square of dull gray to the rest of the show&#039;s collage of explosive color. That&#039;s quite a choice for the show to make right off the bat but I think it is what makes the show really great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These shows that depict a very different sort of world need an audience proxy. We, the audience, need an avatar to identify with and connect us to the foreign world. For example, look at Futurama - the main character is an everyman who is from our time, sent into the future. As Fry learns, so do we. Northern Exposure masters what you might call the 'anti-proxy.' Sure, Dr. Fleischman enables us to discover the world by virtue of the fact that he serves as a clueless character for everybody else to explain things to. However, he isn&#039;t our emotional or spiritual stand-in. He&#039;s kind of an abrasive jerk, he&#039;s completely unreceptive to the culture or wisdom of those around him, and he regularly rejects the olive branches offered by other characters. In this, he becomes this object of our frustration instead of an anchor for our emotional selves. If anything, he&#039;s a proxy not for us, but for our whole culture, and as he evolves and breaks down his proverbial walls, we share in the emotional triumph not with him, but with everyone else. It drives us to feel part of the world, not just outsiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even today I think our culture still has some things to learn about breaking down walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The holidays have arrived in Cicely, Alaska. For each of its diverse inhabitants, that means something a little bit different. We get a cross section of the world, getting several different takes on the holidays. It&#039;s a very customary episode of Northern Exposure, telling a variety of unique stories. Their plots don&#039;t necessarily come together a la Friends, but they connect in a much deeper way. What we have here is an exploration of a theme. Being Christmas, the theme in this particular episode is a pretty special one, indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The titular storyline of the episode revolves around Maurice, the financial head of the small town. He&#039;s a loud, militaristic man - a former soldier and astronaut. His time as an astronaut left him wealthy enough to invest heavily in the town. However, it was his time as a soldier that provided the backstory here. He begins the episode sadly bemoaning his lack of family (which is understandable this time of year). His dreams soon come true in a way, as he is approached by a family of Koreans - a young man, his grandmother, and his father - who turns out to be Maurice&#039;s son. It seems back in his days in the army, Maurice had an affair with a young Korean woman, and now he is confronted by the consequence of that affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maurice, a traditional, conservative, close-minded person, has a hard time dealing with this sudden family. It leads to some very compelling moments - some fun, some deeply touching - as he learns how to wrap his head around it. He fills that 'anti-proxy' role in this episode. It&#039;s incredibly moving and feels so beautifully relevant today, watching this representative of the All American man find common ground with a group of Koreans. The local radio DJ and part-time spiritual guide (and the show&#039;s pseudo-narrator) explains to Maurice about the idea of the 'Other' and how scary someone foreign and different can be. He isn&#039;t just giving another character a few insights, he&#039;s justifying and legitimizing an entire culture&#039;s prejudice and distrust. Just as Maurice is able to let it go only after acknowledging it, perhaps so too can the rest of our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other stories are just as compelling, in their own ways, and each explore this idea of the Other and the self. The very Jewish Dr. Fleischman gets his first Christmas tree, and struggles with his internal monologue and guilt at doing such a non-Jewish gesture. Maggie, local pilot, provides a counterpoint to Maurice&#039;s story by dreading having to deal with the stress and difficulty of spending Christmas with her family. Local restauranteur Shelly struggles with her distance from her Catholic upbringing, and her husband Holling (yes, they&#039;re married) struggles to give her the Catholic Mass that she misses. Through it all we get that insightful and interesting commentary from Chris (the afore-mentioned radio DJ) that is the trademark of the show and an exploration of an important facet of the local native traditions. They make full use of the 40 minute running time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more I think about it, the more I feel like this is the most important episode on my list. Here we have a story about acceptance, not just of the Other, but also a different big 'O' - Ourselves. Christmas, the Holidays, December, whatever you want to call it - it is different for all of us. It is special, and difficult, and hopeful, and painful, and exhausting, and awkward, and depressing, and all that sappy stuff to everyone in their own way. There&#039;s no better example of the magic and beauty of our uniqueness and diversity than that. Our differences are what unite us all, and perhaps the true meaning of Christmas is to simply accept it all with an open heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas is when we tear down our walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose it&#039;s predictable that the episode I found most important is also the most difficult to find. It isn&#039;t available for streaming anywhere (not legally anyway), so your only choice for now is to get the <a href='http://amzn.to/2hHrFr1' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a>. You won&#039;t regret it, though - it&#039;s a great show all around.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem strange that a show about a Jewish dude surrounded by a bunch of Native Americans would actually end up with one of the best lessons about Christmas, but here we are. Really, this episode is the perfect thesis statement to this whole list. There are billions of us on this planet, and there are just as many ways to experience the Holidays. Every single one is important, from the Schweddy Balls to the Airing of Grievances. Let us never lose sight of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now then, let&#039;s completely change gears, and take a look at another show that aired in December 1991 . . .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also, let&#039;s face it, we aren&#039;t exactly talking about the richest chestnut on the fire with this one. That&#039;s not to say that it is any less relevant or qualified for the list. In fact, it&#039;s almost one of my favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim Allen plays Tim 'The Tool Man' Taylor, star of a popular cable show called 'Tool Time' which is a general Bob Vila style home improvement talk show. He embodies and caricaturizes the classic man, with all the power tool wielding, grunting, and muscle car obsession therein. He bumbles his way through his show, because minor burns and electrical accidents are pretty much the height of 90&#039;s sitcom humor. Most of Home Improvement sees Tim at the titular home, though, dealing with his longsuffering wife and three sons. They all experience the regular trials of a suburban middle American family (albeit with the occasional minor electrocution). Most episodes show Tim getting some sage advice from his neighbor, Wilson, whose face we famously never see, and Tim learns a little about what it means to be a father, husband, and man. It&#039;s really about as vanilla as a sitcom can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s nothing wrong with vanilla, though. I would call this show a guilty pleasure, but that would imply that I feel guilt about liking it - which I don&#039;t. You always know where you stand with Home Improvement, which means (at least for me) it&#039;s a nice, warm, cozy place where I can just shut off my brain for 20 minutes and watch some regular people being regular. Especially compared to some of the wacky, fast-paced, and simply 'out there' stuff on this list, it&#039;s kind of interesting to take a look at something so incredibly 'normal.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually kind of like Tim Allen, too. Clearly I&#039;m not alone, as he was the top of Disney&#039;s food chain for at least a year in the 90&#039;s. Let us not forget that he starred in probably the best Christmas movie of all time, even though since it isn&#039;t a TV show it doesn&#039;t qualify for this list. I think he was at his best in <em>Galaxy Quest</em>, which is also not relevant to this list but I still want to mention it because it&#039;s great and you should watch it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, all this is to say that not everything has to be moving, brilliant, or miraculous. Sometimes we can just sit back and have some vanilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas is big in suburban middle America, which means it was almost as much a part of <em>Home Improvement</em>&#039;s DNA as power tools and handyman slapstick. This is the first Christmas episode of the show, so we get introduced to the recurring annual storyline. The Taylor family&#039;s neighborhood has a decoration contest every year which is usually won by an elderly proctologist down the street. Of course this is an endless source of personal humiliation for Tim, and every year he goes even more overboard trying to outdo his neighbors. Meanwhile, the youngest of the family, Mark, has that classic crisis of young children who are growing up - he begins to question the existence of Santa (helped in no small part by his older brothers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know there&#039;s another Christmas episode of <em>Home Improvement</em> that is usually listed as one of the best Christmas shows of all time. I would probably agree that the other one - 'Twas the Flight Before Christmas' from Season Five - was probably a better episode of TV. However, I think 'Yule Better Watch Out' is a better episode of <em>Home Improvement</em>. We see the family together, and most of the episode takes place inside (or on top of) the house. We don&#039;t have any guest stars or visiting relatives or contrived plot devices to try to spice things up. We just get the family, together, doing Christmas the <em>Home Improvement</em> way - with minor electrocution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s really about time ABC pulls <em>Home Improvement</em> out of the vault and offers it up on Netflix or something. For now, we can sate ourselves with the <a href='http://amzn.to/2hA1RfX' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> or <a href='http://amzn.to/2hMgv3V' target='_blank'>Amazon Video</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Last week I was up on the roof of my own Middle-American home installing (albeit modest) Christmas decorations of my own. My neighbor came home with his two kids. I waved to him, he waved back, and we exchanged Merry Christmases. Somehow, for that moment, I felt more Holiday Spirit than perhaps ever before in my life. It felt like such a nice, gentle world to live in. It was such a simple gesture, but it made me feel like I was part of a real community, and I didn&#039;t even have to electrocute myself. Maybe that&#039;s what Christmas is all about. It&#039;s the world that <em>Home Improvement</em> offers, and I&#039;m happy to partake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And speaking of TV shows that are about a dude who makes TV shows . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

I didn&#039;t have cable as a kid (or ever, really), so Nickelodeon was just something that happened to other people. This episode was highly recommended by the Internet, though, so I figured I would give it a shot. I&#039;m totally not padding out my list or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Rugrats is an animated show about three (I think) families who hang out all the time. The families all have roughly toddler-aged kids who can talk and interact basically like adults (because it&#039;s a cartoon). Episodes are usually split into two 10 minute stories, and each story is actually told from two perspectives. We see the kids having some sort of adventure while the parents are having their own in the other room. It was a pretty successful show, spawning at least one movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is actually a fun show, not just because of the crazy animation style, but because that split perspective leads to a lot of interesting stories. By following both the parents and the kids at the same time, the show is able to tell both sides at once. The parents are all trying their best to provide a good life for their children, and the children are, well, children, so they ultimately try their best to foil those plans. The humor doesn&#039;t come at the expense of the characters, by showing the parents being bad parents or the kids being awful kids. Even though it&#039;s a pretty crude and strange art style, there&#039;s something about it that feels real. I guess it illustrates that 'uncanny valley' thing I talked about a few days ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, a lot of the voices are done by Tress Macneille, who is fantastic. You might have recognized her in Futurama, or of course, in The Simpsons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a somewhat special episode of Rugrats in that a single story takes up the entire 22 minute running time. I think it was kind of framed as a sort of Rugrats Christmas Special by Nickelodeon. It&#039;s listed as an episode of season 2, though, so it doesn&#039;t violate my rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angelica (a bratty girl, and oldest of the kids) has an incident with a mall Santa, where he gets 'de-bearded' and she throws a fit about it not being the real Santa. Her father, worried that her childhood innocence is shaken, organizes a huge Christmas outing for the whole gang. They get a cabin out in the woods and hire a professional to come in and give the kids the 'real Santa experience.' Being a TV show, things don&#039;t exactly go as planned, but being a children&#039;s cartoon, everything works out great in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has a lot of fun moments. Two of the young boys are afraid of Santa, which is a fun twist on the Christmas story. Sometimes it&#039;s easy to lose sight of the fact that we&#039;re telling children that some strange fat man breaks into your house (no matter if you have a real chimney or not), watches you even when you sleep, and knows everything about you. It&#039;s perfectly legitimate (and probably more common than you might think) to be a little afraid of that. We also get another take on the Gift of the Magi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s another simple fun time, without any baggage. If some of those shows that were earlier on the list are to be believed, watching children open presents is the best thing you can do on Christmas. If so, a cartoon about children on Christmas should be pretty solid. Besides, there&#039;s nothing like Sunday morning for watching cartoons. Hey, it&#039;s Sunday today!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole series is on Hulu, or (as usual) the <a href='http://amzn.to/2gXbTYR' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a>  and <a href='http://amzn.to/2gXihze' target='_blank'>episodes</a> are on Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#039;s see, what&#039;s next on the list . . . Ah, yes. So . . . I guess one of the kids in this episode was scared. What&#039;s more scary . . . than murder . . . ?</p>\r\n\r\n",

I watched a lot of Monk a few years ago, because it was on Netflix. Then they took it off Netflix, because reasons. I did make it as far as this episode, though, so I&#039;m basically an expert.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Tony Shalhoub stars as Adrian Monk, an extremely eccentric and neurotic former Police, currently private detective working in San Francisco.  He was let go from the police force some time before the show begins, after his wife was killed and he kind of went all crazy. His (literally) insane attention to detail makes him infuriatingly obsessive compulsive, an extreme germaphobe, nearly incapable of social interaction, and kind of a drag at parties. However, it also makes him an incredibly talented detective, noticing tiny details that most others would ignore. As he often puts it, 'it&#039;s a gift, and a curse.' Through the course of the show he slowly recovers his reputation and respect as he helps the San Francisco police department solve some sinister plots, capers, and murder cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monk is essentially a retelling of the whole Sherlock Holmes mythos. Each episode follows a reasonably formulaic pattern - establish a sinister plot, establish some awkward social situation for Monk to deal with, Monk figures out whodunit, nobody believes him, bad guy almost gets away with it, Monk says 'except' and throws down some tiny detail that proves whodunit, everybody has a good chuckle (except the bad guy, of course). We usually get some antics involving the two police detectives who work with him, and the young woman who is essentially his caretaker (I guess they are like his Dr. Who companions). It&#039;s the same old 'troubled genius' trope that has been serialized on TV many times. This particular blend is light on the drama, giving it a fun, lighthearted, almost silly feel throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show ran for eight seasons, so it&#039;s more than just a retelling of an old trope. Each mystery is concise and just clever enough to be interesting. Monk&#039;s big 'except' moment does a good job of staying on the good side of plausible. The show never tries to make you feel dumb. You can feel free to sit back, relax, and come along for the ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wouldn&#039;t call it perfect, though. They try to make the other characters actually interesting, but Tony Shalhoub is still the only reason to watch the show (that&#039;s fine, though, because only about 2% of the show is not featuring him). Sometimes the dependence on Monk&#039;s eccentricities is a little obvious, too. For example, this Christmas episode opens with Monk obsessing over a plate of gingerbread cookies. It&#039;s obvious that he sees some detail that needs to be fixed, not because he wants to eat it. When all of the other characters were shocked that he threw one of the cookies away, it just seemed a little stupid. I knew he was going to do that, and I don&#039;t work with him every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, all that is just nitpicking. Monk is a great show, and it&#039;s worth catching if you can (except when they stupidly pull it off Netflix).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>In this episode, Monk meets his father (as indicated by the title of the episode). Monk&#039;s father abandoned him and his family when he was just a kid, so it isn&#039;t exactly a happy reunion. Monk is convinced to go along with his father on a long-haul truck delivery, and along the way they learn how to respect one another. Also they solve a murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s only really a Christmas episode because it happens to be set during Christmas time. Nothing really Christmas-ey happens, but there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. The themes of family and setting aside your differences are very strong here, and as we&#039;ve seen over the last 18 days, those are very Christmas-ey things indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It isn&#039;t on Netflix anymore (ugh), so you&#039;ll have to shell out some cash for the <a href='http://amzn.to/2i6EuHg' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> or the <a href='http://amzn.to/2hA5v99' target='_blank'>episodes</a> on Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>There really are plenty of fun shows to choose from for this list. We&#039;ve had cartoons, sitcoms, variety shows, and now a detective procedural. I&#039;m not usually into these kinds of shows, but Monk is just fun enough that I can overlook the tedium inherent in the genre. There are just two things missing from the list, though - a lawyer show and a hospital show. Well, we&#039;ve looked at the police, so let&#039;s see the other side of the criminal justice system . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "<h5>Boston Legal <br />\r\nSeason 3 Episode 10 <br />\r\n'The Nutcrackers'</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally broadcast December 5, 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='https://storage.cloud.google.com/denyconformity_assets/advent2016/tv_boston_legal03.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably the most mature show on my list, what with all the lecherous behavior exhibited by the two main characters. However, it was on ABC, so if they are okay with it I don&#039;t see why I should be afraid of it. Even more than cop procedurals, I am usually not a fan of lawyer shows. However, this one has William Shatner in it, which is all it takes for me to watch a thing, apparently.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Boston Legal is a spinoff of The Practice, which was another (less Shatner-heavy) lawyer show by the same production company. Near the end of that show, they introduced the character Alan Shore, a conceited, bad-boy lawyer played by James Spader. I never watched The Practice, so I don&#039;t know how it ended, but I assume it was with Alan Shore giving a closing speech so devastating that the entire cast of that show immediately quit being lawyers. Boston Legal starts with Alan joining the prestigious Boston law firm Crane, Poole, and Schmidt. He continues his bad-boy antics, to the chagrin of most of the firm&#039;s senior staff, except for Denny Crane, the boisterous and deeply conservative head partner of the firm, played by William Shatner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, it&#039;s your basic lawyer show (I assume, anyway). You&#039;ve got plenty of courtroom scenes, judges and opposing lawyers played by an array of guest-stars, lots of topical and politically charged themes, and the occasional inter-office affair. Okay, so it was created by David E. Kelley, so those affairs are quite a bit more often than occasional. There&#039;s usually an 'A' team and a 'B' team in each episode, and each one gets a case that they have to do, with some sort of crazy twist that is almost too much to handle. However, they usually win out in the end, often by delivering an incredibly poignant closing argument (James Spader&#039;s delivery in this show is the reason I love him). The dialog is snappy and high-brow, the characters are interesting and reasonably diverse, and the classic David Kelley pace is front and center, driving you through each episode like a bullet train. It&#039;s just irreverent and self-aware enough to not be obnoxious about it, which is a fine line to tread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than that, though, Boston Legal is a show about faith in oneself. Early in the show, Shatner&#039;s character is diagnosed with essentially pre-alzheimers, and throughout the show he is struggling with that. Alan Shore often finds himself embroiled in cases with deep political and religious implications, and must fight the uphill battle of defending his liberal leanings in the rather conservative climate of the early to mid 2000&#039;s. One of the other senior partners, Shirley Schmidt, played by the always awesome Candice Bergen, struggles with being a powerful woman in a notoriously sexist and male-dominated field. Boston Legal shows characters constantly faced with challenges that question their deeply held beliefs. It&#039;s a show about sticking to one&#039;s guns (in the case of Denny Crane, sometimes that&#039;s literal). Of course, it&#039;s easy to stick to your guns when you&#039;re the 'good guy' in a TV show, but the writers do pull the rug out from under us just enough to make us begin to question whether the team can really pull it off every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes they stray a little too far into silliness, especially with Shatner&#039;s character. It can feel a little exploitative and inappropriate, but those moments are somewhat rare, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast is great, it needs to be said. Spader and Shatner are fantastic (I&#039;m a huge fan of both, anyway). Candice Bergen is always a powerhouse. I feel like Mark Valley is a very underappreciated TV actor and it&#039;s great to see him apply his chiseled jaw and self aware sincerity here (does anybody remember Keen Eddie?). Rene Auberjonois does a great job as an eternally frustrated administrator (he has less makeup here than he did in Deep Space Nine). I think Julie Bowen is actually better in Boston Legal than she is in Modern Family. Constance Zimmer does a great job (in this episode specifically), and I&#039;d love to see her in something else that&#039;s actually good. Gary Anthony Williams - Malcolm in the Middle regular - is a pretty great recurring character for a while. Plus later on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwoDhAp2VzY' target='_blank'>John Larroquette</a> shows up, presumably to reprise his role from Night Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can imagine, it&#039;s Christmas Time in Boston. Much like yesterday&#039;s episode, this one is not really a Christmas story as much as it is just an episode of the show that happens to be during Christmas. In this episode, we get three cases, but each has a certain Christmas-ey theme to it. We have a mother trying to get her daughter to stop being anorexic facing off against the daughter&#039;s lawyer who is also anorexic, the family trying to keep their two young daughters who they raised to be a white-supremacist folk duo, and a woman who wants to sue God. Yeah, it&#039;s definitely a David E. Kelley show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does have that cutting, fast-paced wit, though. Alan Shore, eternal liberal, gets assigned the case to defend this legitimately awful white supremacist family, which is a perspective we don&#039;t always get in this kind of show. Even if it flies in the face of his judgement, he still has to do his job. That theme is carried through the entire episode, as two lawyers on the 'B' team have to work together despite their continued hatred for each other. We also see the re-introduction of Gary Anthony Williams&#039; shy, nervous (but brilliant) character Clarence. He applies for a job as his much more outgoing alter-ego Clarice, but is challenged with the difficult task of being himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the episode we see characters setting aside their comfort zones and personal preferences to do what needs to be done. If that isn&#039;t Christmas, I don&#039;t know what is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#039;s the challenging bit. The <a href='http://amzn.to/2ib7MES' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> are on Amazon, of course, but I can&#039;t really find a way to stream this episode anywhere. At least, not legally. I mean, you can definitely search for 'Boston Legal Season 3 Episode 10' and you just might find something. I&#039;m not telling you to do that, of course, but if you were to do that, I would say that you should watch out for ads and don&#039;t click on anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What do you need to know?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This show has a lot of running narrative that might not make much sense if you only watch this episode. On the other hand, the characters are pretty straightforward so I think you&#039;ll catch on to most of the stuff without the context of the rest of the series. At least, up until the last scene (the office Christmas party), where we basically get a parade of characters from previous episodes showing up, including Delta Burke (so there are actually two drag queens in this episode - just kidding). You don&#039;t really need to know who any of those people are to make sense of the episode, though, so I think you can just go with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Boston Legal is one of my favorite shows. I&#039;m not exactly sure why, since I usually avoid lawyer shows. I feel like TV producers think that there has to be a lawyer show, a cop show, and a doctor show on some network at all times. Maybe they&#039;re super easy to make, or maybe they are just known to be successful, or maybe they always end up being successful because they end up being all that&#039;s on TV anymore. Whatever the case, they managed to actually come up with something fun with Boston Legal. Now if only they would put it out on Netflix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&#039;re on the subject of surprisingly excellent examples of clich&eacute; TV genres . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

I only have four more items for my list including today (I&#039;m not going to make you read anything on Christmas day). The rest of the things will (hopefully) not be as long as most of these posts have been, as it&#039;s time to just relax and reflect on the year behind us. Today, however, we make our last stop on the heartwarming side of the spectrum (which means this is another long one). You get bonus points if, like me, reading the name of this episode gets that one Depeche Mode song stuck in your head.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrubs follows the career of young doctor John &#039;J.D.&#039; Dorian and his best friend Chris Turk as they work their way through residencies at a busy hospital. The show starts with his first day on the job, and showcases the personalities that make up the hospital&#039;s staff. He laughs, he loves, and he learns as the chaotic world of modern medicine keeps him and his friends busy. It somewhat feels like a 20 minute version of Zach Braff&#039;s movie Garden State, but with a bit more interesting subject matter. Yeah, it&#039;s kind of hipster-ey or emo or whatever we were calling it in the early 2000&#039;s, and it can be easy to dismiss it for that. Just get over yourself and enjoy something for once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s a pretty successful comedy, but it is also incredibly grounded. Quite a few episodes and plot lines are based on the experiences of real hospital staff. I&#039;ve only visited hospitals a handful of times in my life, so I can&#039;t really know, but at least from an outsider&#039;s perspective the show feels incredibly realistic. The doctors, nurses, and other staff are overworked, struggle with moral and ethical dilemmas, and find relationships and personal lives where they can. It isn&#039;t overly dramatized or over sexualized, and it doesn&#039;t feel exploitative. It does flash to the surreal from time to time, when we get a glimpse of JD&#039;s inner thoughts, but those moments are used to emphasize what&#039;s happening in the scene, not make fun of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The setting and tone really work so well only because the characters are great. Working long hours, under very stressful situations, I&#039;m sure a lot of hospital staffs become like families, and Scrubs takes full advantage of that. JD is taken under the wing of Dr. Cox, played brilliantly by John C. McGinley. He is a mean, loud, insulting, and otherwise terrifying presence in the hospital. At the same time, Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins), the chief of medicine is a kind-hearted old man. As it turns out, though, Cox&#039;s furious demeanor belies a clear respect and affection for JD, and we soon discover that he may be the only doctor in the place who really cares. Kelso soon makes it clear that his gentle, kindhearted exterior is simply a mask for his apathetic, cynical, and uncaring attitude. Each character, down to the jock surgeon and the scary janitor who constantly bullies JD, has this level of depth and three-dimensionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#039;s always great to see a comedy not derive comedy from incompetence. It can be very easy to make jokes about how bad somebody is at their job. The Office leans heavily on this early on, as it puts a great deal of attention on how awkward and incompetent Michael is. However, that can&#039;t sustain a show for long, and The Office only really became compelling when we started to see signs of talent under Michael&#039;s awkward shell. Scrubs wastes no time insulting its characters by trying to make them bad at things for cheap laughs. Sure, they can be clumsy, they can make mistakes, and they fail, but those failings are used as character development, not joke development. As a result, Scrubs has characters that you can have faith in. You root for them to succeed, and you cry with them when they fail. You become part of their family.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The central point of this episode, like most episodes of the show, is to emphasize what life is like for doctors in a hospital. Here we see Turk, the most religiously faithful of the main characters, has a crisis of that very faith as he has to work through the holiday. After being called again and again all night as the emergencies roll in, Turk questions whether there&#039;s any meaning left to it all. It&#039;s a pretty powerful subject to consider just a few days before the holiday, and it definitely puts into perspective some of these other shows where someone is worried that maybe Santa doesn&#039;t exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, we see a pair of stories about birth. A birth is pretty central to the Christmas story, after all, so it&#039;s an artful theme to leverage in a holiday episode - especially one set in a hospital. They leverage the theme incredibly well, because there&#039;s a lot of subject matter there. We get a juxtaposition between a well-off upper-middle-class couple and a young, poor, single woman (who didn&#039;t even know she was pregnant). It becomes a modern 'no room at the inn' scenario, which is a classic holiday TV trope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also get a glimpse at perhaps the real theme of the episode - the inherent misogyny of the whole process. Systemic sexism is a very real thing, especially in the medical industry (also, let us not forget that this day is about glorifying not the poor, young woman who had to give birth in whatever a manger even is, but the male baby - and his father - that she gave birth to). This episode comes out swinging, throwing out two pretty sexist ideas in as many minutes, and those ideas permeate the rest of the episode. In the same way that the show handles most subjects, they don&#039;t force an agenda down our throats - we aren&#039;t subjected to a lecture about what&#039;s wrong with the system. We are simply shown a slice of (what at least feels like) reality, with all of the goods and bads that come along with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire series is on Netflix (you can skip the last season or two), and as usual the <a href='http://amzn.to/2i0VKyr' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a> and <a href='http://amzn.to/2ifCfl7' target='_blank'>episodes</a> are on Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>This is a powerful episode for me. It can be easy to forget (or ignore) that ultimately Christmas is just another day, and someone still needs to be on call to provide care to those who need it. We give a lot of glory to all of the mythos that surrounds the holiday, but can we not take a moment to sing a carol about the young surgeon who has to work on Christmas so that people who get hurt will still be saved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#039;t figure out a good way to transition into the next episode(s). I have 25 episodes of TV shows, and I couldn&#039;t think of a single thing in common with the next one. Anyway, it&#039;s The Simpsons.</p>\r\n",

There was The Simpsons, and then all other shows. Well, I guess you could say that about any TV show, but the point is that The Simpsons has a very special place in my heart (the first 10 seasons or so, at least).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the show?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The Simpsons are a middle-class family in suburban anywhere, and the show follows their dysfunctional adventures. Come on, though, you know what The Simpsons are. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are kind of as much a part of my family as a bunch of cartoon characters could be. When I was a kid, I took pride in having seen every single episode (which was pretty cool in a pre-Internet world). It was the first show that I followed religiously, and I remember talking about the show and making jokes about it all the way back in Elementary school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#039;m not sure what I could add to the discourse about The Simpsons that hasn&#039;t already been said in the last 27 years. It&#039;s one of the longest running shows ever (I am pretty sure it is definitely the longest running animated series ever), and though it could be argued that it has overstayed its welcome by, oh, a good 17 years or so, it still stands alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s a reason a common Internet joke is 'The Simpsons did it,' referring to the fact that basically everything you can imagine has happened on the show at one point or another. There&#039;s a Simpsons reference to pretty much any given moment. Just look back on my other posts here and count how many times I mentioned the show (and those are just the ones that came obviously). It&#039;s a pillar, perhaps one of the most important figures in popular culture, and it has definitely shaped my childhood to some degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the episode?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas is coming soon, and Bart gets excited about a super cool new video game called <em>Bonestorm</em>. Marge refuses to buy it for him, though, and through some bad peer pressure from the local hooligans, Bart decides to steal it. He gets caught and banned from the store, which becomes a problem when Marge brings the whole family there for family pictures. Bart gets in trouble, and it strains his relationship with the whole family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other perhaps more noteworthy Christmas episodes, but this is the one I remember. Perhaps it struck a chord with me in particular, being a young man who often wanted expensive video games myself. The show really did a great job developing the emotional core of this episode, and I think that really stuck with me. As a kid, I could feel the embarrassment and regret that Bart feels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bask in the glory of early to mid 90&#039;s Simpsons, and you won&#039;t need another show again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#039;s the problem. Aside from catching it the next time FX has a marathon of the entire series (or just drawing from your memories of having watched it a hundred times), I&#039;m not sure where you can get it on demand. You can always get the <a href='http://amzn.to/2ijlrcW' target='_blank'>DVD&#039;s</a>, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>We only have two more episodes left on the list. Can you guess what they might be? Spoiler: I can&#039;t pick just one episode of The Simpsons.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Exactly six years before the episode I posted yesterday was the very first episode of what would become one of the most popular shows ever. Okay, so it wasn&#039;t technically the first appearance of everybody&#039;s favorite dysfunctional family, but it was the first independent episode of the show. It also happened to be a Christmas episode, so it&#039;s a perfect selection for the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#039;t actually know that this was the first episode, since I mostly watched the show on repeat, and when they just show random episodes every day, they don&#039;t really tell you what number each episode is. I was kind of surprised to learn that this was the episode that started it all, but it&#039;s a good launching point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this episode, we get our introduction to The Simpsons, in all their poverty-stricken glory. Bart is immediately introduced as the bad boy of TV, getting a tattoo, and Marge spends all of the family&#039;s Christmas money getting it removed. Homer has to take on a second job to cover the bills. I guess back in the late 80&#039;s, the idea of a family with a comfortable house and firm employment being poverty-stricken (not to mention that getting a tattoo is the worst possible thing a kid can do) was a legitimate idea. It was a simpler time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, go check it out. How much do you think times have changed since the cartoon 80&#039;s? Also, how great is the animation in this show?</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Where can you watch it?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href='http://amzn.to/2hPWhpw' target='_blank'>DVD</a> set is on Amazon, like always, or <a href='http://amzn.to/2hPM9Nl' target='_blank'>stream</a> individual episodes. You can also just wait for FX to stream the whole series again (but be ready right when it starts).</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we&#039;ve almost made it through the entire month. There&#039;s just one episode left for me to share with you. I can&#039;t let all this attention slip by without promoting something of my own . . .</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "Which Portable Battery Pack Should I Buy?",
      "text": "<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go far to see some editorial about how we live in an &ldquo;interconnected world&rdquo; full of &ldquo;gadgets and devices&rdquo; and everybody is just looking for the nearest Wifi hotspot and / or wall outlet to get some much needed juice. We have come to the inevitable realization of this world - we need more power. Since phone companies insist on putting smaller and smaller batteries in these devices and we insist on never having a moment without being connected to Facebook Messenger, an entire sub-industry has sprung up to help us make it through those long flights, survive being away from any outlets, and sometimes even just make it through the day. I&rsquo;m talking of course about the hot new gift for that special someone you don&rsquo;t really know very well but the guy at Best Buy said would like it - portable battery-powered chargers. The question is, though, which one should I buy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve put off thinking about these things because for the most part I haven&rsquo;t really felt the need. I&rsquo;ve usually had phones that last a very long time (thanks, Motorola), and I don&rsquo;t usually do much traveling. However, now that I&rsquo;m a proud owner of a Nintendo Switch (which is super great), I feel that I should be prepared for the inevitable situation where I will be stuck on an airplane playing Skyrim (as I was promised by the Switch&rsquo;s introduction) and the &ldquo;low battery&rdquo; warning comes on. Maybe the time has finally come to get a battery backup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s just establish what device chargers are doing (hopefully without it coming off as mansplaining). Electricity sent from one place to another is measured by amperage (the amount of electricity flowing into the device) and voltage (the electrical current&rsquo;s &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;). Most standard USB chargers operate at 5 volts and about 1 amp. Sometimes they have more amps, going up to 2 or 2.5, but that precise voltage is pretty set in stone (that&rsquo;s the number that can cause damage). As long as you&rsquo;re getting at least 1 amp any regular old USB charging will work just fine, including my bluetooth headphones (0.4A), my smartwatch (1A), or even an Amazon Echo Dot (1.8A). It can be pretty hard to find out how many V&rsquo;s and A&rsquo;s a device prefers, simply because as long as it&rsquo;s close enough (and since every USB charger deals in 5 volts) stuff will probably work out okay. Therefore, the output of a charger&rsquo;s ports - though often a major selling point - don&rsquo;t really matter that much for most devices. Sure, some might charge my phone a little faster than others, but pretty much anything should at least be satisfactory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that any charger (or USB port on a computer) worth its salt will be able to handle coordinating with the device plugged into it to deliver the voltage and amperage that won&rsquo;t destroy that device. Trying to charge my power-sipping headphones with the firehose of electricity that my phone can handle will end catastrophically. However, the charger has some magical circuitry inside it to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. I can rest assured that probably any charger will work reasonably well with any device as long as it isn&rsquo;t some chintzy dollar store piece of junk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More powerful (or power hungry) hardware will involve higher amperage and voltage, but generally &ldquo;more power&rdquo; means more voltage. The power adapter for my phone - the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 - outputs 2.15 amps at 12 volts. That coordinates with special circuitry in my phone to increase the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; of the electrical flow and thereby fill up the battery much more quickly. This tech goes under a few different names depending on who is trying to sell it to you, and there&rsquo;s a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo to it, but it generally boils down to the <a href='https://www.qualcomm.com/products/features/quick-charge'>Qualcomm &ldquo;Quick Charge&rdquo; standard</a>, for those keeping score at home. Phones are continuing to support QC tech, but a new technology has changed the game a little bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A USB port on a computer usually only outputs at 0.5A (or 0.9A for USB 3), so plugging something into a computer to charge it will never work super well. To make a long story short (well, shorter), USB was never actually intended to be a power delivery standard. That is one of the reasons the industry is moving to the shiny new USB Type C standard, which includes capacity for much higher power throughput. If you ask some people (for example, the people who design Macbooks), in a few years everything will just use USB-C. Time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some devices, the future is now. The Nintendo Switch, for example, reports that its desired input is 15 V at 2.6 A. It wants a lot more power than a plain and simple smartphone or tablet. In the past, Nintendo has had to put special proprietary charging ports on its devices, but the Switch just has a standard USB-C port. My portable computer, an aging Surface Pro 3, uses 12V at 2.5A through a proprietary (and in my opinion awesome) magnetic charging connector. There are some rumors that Microsoft is going to release an adapter to connect a USB-C cable to that magnetic port, which would be super awesome (meaning I could probably use a USB-C wall plug to charge it). These devices utilize a particular part of the USB-C standard called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#PD'>&ldquo;PowerDelivery&rdquo; or &ldquo;USB-C PD.&rdquo;</a> This allows a USB-C port to deliver as much as 20V and 5A, while still allowing full data throughput. A device with USB-C PD would be able to handle charging basically anything out there with a USB-C port, from a phone (most Android phones have USB-C nowadays) to a laptop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have read articles saying that the Switch will still work fine with much less than that 15/2.6 level that it craves. Supposedly some of the portable chargers with more standard 5v 2A output will be able to at least keep the Switch alive while you use it. I could save a lot of money by getting one of those less capable devices. However, I feel like it&rsquo;s not the best idea to get something that only barely works today. As more devices use USB-C, it will only be less useful. Also, I like the idea of being able to power a laptop with it, too. If I&rsquo;m going to invest in a battery backup, I want one that will work with as many devices as possible, for as long as possible. It&#039;s a common problem with gadgets - do I save money now for something that won&#039;t be as future-proof, or do I make an investment now in something that will hopefully be useful for longer? I hate having to figure out what to do with old devices I don&#039;t use anymore, so I&#039;m going to try to get something that I can hang onto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other major selling point of portable chargers is their battery capacity. Capacity is measured in milliamp hours (mAh), and ranges from the hundreds to the tens of thousands. What capacity you might need is kind of just dependent on what you really want. A good starting point would be to see what capacity your devices have. The two most important devices that I would want to charge are my phone and my Switch, which take 3760 and 4310 mAh, respectively. Therefore, anything over 10,000 would fully charge both of those and still have some juice left over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to recap, the features I definitely want include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>USB-C PowerDelivery</li>\r\n<li>USB-A (The standard USB port that has been around for 20 years)</li>\r\n<li>USB-C Input</li>\r\n<li>Charge level indicator (so I can see how charged the backup is)</li>\r\n<li>At least 10,000 mAh capacity</li>\r\n<li>Amazon Prime (because come on)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The features I would also like include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Less than $50 price</li>\r\n<li>Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0+</li>\r\n<li>Multiple USB-C ports</li>\r\n<li>MicroUSB input support (for additional charging option)</li>\r\n<li>Support for up to 15V and 2.6A over USB-C, for the Switch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have some idea what features to look for, let&rsquo;s dive on into the wild world of portable battery packs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brand&rdquo; filter, there are literally hundreds of companies that make these things. Seriously, there are 139 names listed under &ldquo;M&rdquo; alone. Here are some of the &ldquo;Top Brands&rdquo; that stood out to me, either because I&rsquo;ve heard of them before, or because I think their name is funny:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Anker</li>\r\n<li>AUKEY (&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m starting a portable battery pack company!&rdquo; &ldquo;Aukey daukey!&rdquo;)</li>\r\n<li>Co2Crea (because you don&rsquo;t need to translate a name that isn&rsquo;t written in language)</li>\r\n<li>DULLA (There&rsquo;s nobody duller than Dulla!)</li>\r\n<li>ExpertPower (certainly puts into question how qualified the other options are)</li>\r\n<li>Hermitshell (Did nobody proofread that?)</li>\r\n<li>iFORWAY (How do you come up with a name like this?)</li>\r\n<li>iNiCE (I like to think when they settled on making the second &lsquo;i&rsquo; lowercase as well, they really knew they were onto something)</li>\r\n<li>Jackery (some people are Jack, some are Jacker - those dudes have the most Jackery-ness)</li>\r\n<li>JENTXON (how, exactly, is this pronounced?)</li>\r\n<li>Kunstworker ( . . . wait . . . what?)</li>\r\n<li>Mophie</li>\r\n<li>Mopower (nice)</li>\r\n<li>Nekteck (if these aren&rsquo;t worn around your neck, they&rsquo;ve really wasted an opportunity)</li>\r\n<li>Pac2Go (well, yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s what it is)</li>\r\n<li>Pocket Juice (kind of on the nose)</li>\r\n<li>RAVPower</li>\r\n<li>Samsung (insert your own explosion joke here)</li>\r\n<li>Stalion (they use that sweet name to make portable battery packs?)</li>\r\n<li>TROND (you can&rsquo;t not spell this in all caps)</li>\r\n<li>Tronsmart (it&rsquo;s like Walmart, but for Tron)</li>\r\n<li>U-good (most companies want to make themselves look better, this one starts right out with a compliment to their customers)</li>\r\n<li>Uni-Yeap (I don&rsquo;t know what a Yeap is, but I suppose you only really need one of them)</li>\r\n<li>ZEROLEMON (yeah, sure, I believe that)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, we can assume that the hundreds of names not included in the &ldquo;Top Brands&rdquo; make products we probably aren&rsquo;t interested in, either because they&rsquo;re some licensed brand (for example, Michael Kors has a portable battery pack on Amazon it turns out), some weird niche thing, or some piece of garbage that I definitely don&rsquo;t want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even just focusing on these top companies gives us a whopping 360 product options. Let&rsquo;s dive in, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='' target='_blank'>USB C Portable Charger RAVPower 20100 Power Bank QC 3.0 Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 20100mAh Input & Output Type C Battery Pack for Macbook, Galaxy S8, iPhone and More</a>\r\n<p>$49.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019IFIJW8/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=4a364007792ed728a35dec86f5d2b389' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B019IFIJW8&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li2&o=1&a=B019IFIJW8' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even though this seems to be on the higher end of the legitimacy spectrum, this page sets off some of my warning bells. When a company throws all of a product&rsquo;s features into the product name on Amazon, it usually isn&rsquo;t a great sign. Also, the RAVPower brand doesn&rsquo;t really exist outside these devices. Even these devices seem to be somewhat standard components all thrown together as cheaply as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this charger sure seems to tick a lot of boxes. We have USB-C (there&rsquo;s no mention of PD here, but it does mention the Switch by name at least), Qualcomm Quick Charge, an ample capacity for my needs, and it&rsquo;s all less than fifty bucks. What&rsquo;s more, it can charge from MicroUSB as well as USB-C, and it supports Quick Charge on the input as well as the output, which is pretty cool. We have four ports here - a single USB-C, a MicroUSB, and two USB-A ports (one labeled &ldquo;Quick Charge&rdquo; and another called &ldquo;iSmart&rdquo;). It supports 5V / 2.4A on the USB ports and can go up to 12V for QC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;iSmart&rdquo; buzzword is a definite example of the snake oil you get in these devices. The page claims that it allows this device to &ldquo;automatically detect the optimal current for your device.&rdquo; Since the charger that comes with literally every single device you own already does this, it isn&rsquo;t a feature worth bragging about (though I guess it&rsquo;s good to know that this won&rsquo;t destroy something plugged into it). They also promise a &ldquo;Premium LG / Panasonic battery cell.&rdquo; Okay, so you sourced lithium batteries from a company that makes lithium batteries. Good job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for downsides, there is only one USB-C port, which means I would need a USB-A to USB-C cable to charge two USB-C devices at once, which is not ideal. Also, the USB-C port caps out at 5V / 3A, which means it does not have any PowerDelivery capacity, and that really limits this thing&rsquo;s future value. That&rsquo;s more important to me than Quick Charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leads us to...</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/2eTLNFS' target='_blank'>PD USB C Hubs Portable Charger RAVPower 20100 Power Bank 20100mAh 30W (Max.)

How is this device any different from the last one? It seems to be the same capacity and form factor, it has the same port selection, and it just has a few different seemingly made-up buzzwords sprinkled throughout the description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One good clue is the &ldquo;30W&rdquo; in the product title. You have to scroll way down to the chart comparing this to the obnoxiously vast library of other nearly identical RAVPower devices before you get the official declaration of PD support. So this charger loses QC to get USB-C PD instead. That means the USB-C port will be much faster on this device (up to 20V/1.5A) while the USB-A port (and MicroUSB input) will be slower (only 5V/2.4A). I think ultimately this would be better moving forward, since USB-C is the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does 30W have to do with this? It turns out Wattage is equal to Volts * Amps, so 20V * 1.5A = 30W. This is why you will see the Amps go down as the Volts go up on these devices. It&rsquo;s all complicated mumbo-jumbo, but different companies will use all this terminology in different ways to make things seem more impressive. 30 Watts sounds like a nice big number, but it comes at the expense of Amperage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also get the &ldquo;incredible&rdquo; &ldquo;iSmart 3.0&rdquo; with this device, which is I assume roughly 33% more smart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kind of want to avoid RAVPower purely for the obnoxious number of products that they make. According to the brand filter on Amazon, there are 40 different RAVPower battery banks available for purchase. I thought electric toothbrushes were hard to choose. Why in the world do we need 40 different options for portable battery pack? You want a smaller, cheaper version and a larger, more feature-packed option? Fine. You want a newer model with more advanced features? Fine. You do not need to do that 40 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does RAVPower have anything that would be perfect? What&rsquo;s the most expensive, top of the line, RAVPower portable charger?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/2w6FqCo' target='_blank'>AC Portable Charger, RAVPower 27000mAh 100W(Max.)

That means anything with a wall plug that uses less than 100W (or 70W, which it says in the description down the page) can plug into this thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it only has one USB-C, no mention of Qualcomm Quick Charge or USB-C PD, and a pretty absurd price tag. Also, the fact that it needs active cooling is kind of crazy (and means I would be afraid to keep it in a bag or pocket). Also also it charges from its own special, old-school wall plug, and not from the ubiquitous micro-USB, which really cuts into the convenience of the whole thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, with all of those options, RAVPower still hasn&rsquo;t found the right design. A company&rsquo;s goal should be to make a product that people want to buy, but these people can&rsquo;t even figure out what they want to build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of too many options&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/2v4r4px' target='_blank'>mophie Powerstation 8X Dual USB External Battery for Smartphones and Tablets (15,000 mAh) - Space Grey</a>\r\n<p>69.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/mophie-Powerstation-External-Battery-Smartphones/dp/B01BD8EYM2/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=f1858fb54ca1f415ac5a52204c3efd0d' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01BD8EYM2&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li2&o=1&a=B01BD8EYM2' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we have one of the major players in the portable charger space. They have decided this means they have reached the point where they can charge more money simply for the privilege of having a product with their name on it. They also have even more products than RAVPower, with 51 listings on Amazon in the Portable Power Pack category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have even fewer of those that are any good, from what I can tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take this option (only figuratively, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend spending money on it). No USB-C at all, no mention of any quick charge features or even what capacity its ports are. A paltry 15,000 mAh for a hundred bucks?

A price like that is definitely too good to be true. Also it has no USB-C and it caps out at 3.4A. I&rsquo;d love to be able to buy something called TROND, but this isn&rsquo;t it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon makes it hard to just filter by products that include USB-C / PD functionality, so I have to slog through everything to find them manually. Since I want to be able to use this with the Switch or any modern Android phone, it really needs to at least have one USB-C port on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\r\n<a href='http://amzn.to/2w7biXE' target='_blank'>Anker PowerCore+ 26800 PD with 27W PD Portable Charger Bundle for Nintendo Switch & USB Type-C Laptops (e.g. 2016 MacBook) Power Delivery Support</a>\r\n<p>$109.99</p>\r\n<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Nintendo-Delivery/dp/B01MZ61PRW//ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=denyconfocom-20&linkId=2567c5f507660cec296a75fc4cc0b9e2' target='_blank'><img border='0' src='//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MZ61PRW&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=denyconfocom-20' ></a><img src='https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=denyconfocom-20&l=li2&o=1&a=B01MZ61PRW' width='1' height='1' border='0' alt='' style='border:none !important; margin:0px !important;' /></p>\r\n</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Anker is a pretty big name in portable chargers, and they seem to have a similar library of options to RAVPower. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of buzzword bells and whistles here, just two USB-A ports, a USB-C (used for both input and output), and a little button up top to check the status. It takes full advantage of PD, even name-dropping the Switch right there in the product name. The capacity is kind of absurd, really (it would fully recharge the Switch 6 times and have some juice left over). It doesn&rsquo;t say exactly what the numbers are on the USB-C port (it promises 30W, so we&rsquo;re probably dealing with 15V/1.5A). The two USB-A ports offer 5V/3A, which is perfectly fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely an option, but it&rsquo;s also definitely a pricey one. I would happily pay less money to have a smaller capacity version. Some companies have too many options, apparently Anker has too few. I just can&rsquo;t be pleased.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like RAVPower, Anker makes far too many of these things.

If that&rsquo;s the killer feature that I simply must have (and for lack of a better idea, I have to limit the selection somehow). Anker&rsquo;s device has a lot more capacity for a lot more money. The RAVPower option is a bit cheaper, probably in price as well as quality. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the RAVPower charger doesn&rsquo;t come with a USB-C wall adapter, so I would have to use one of the old micro-USB chargers I have laying around to charge it (the fact that it has the micro USB option is a good feature). Considering in a matter of years I&rsquo;m swimming in extra micro USB chargers, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have plenty of USB-C adapters I can use in no time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that finally settles it, then. I have four conclusions to draw from my time researching portable chargers. There are far, far too many options, you can&rsquo;t have good USB-C support and Quick Charge at the same time, mophie sucks, and the <a href='http://amzn.to/2eTLNFS' target='_blank'>RAVPower 20100 mAh with PD</a> is probably the best combination of features, future-proofing, and price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phew, that ended up being much more time consuming than I expected it to be.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Exactly who has said this and exactly who this proverbial One is remains unspecified. However, since this is being included as the opening paragraph of a Very Serious Story, it must be regarded as true. Those Ones who remember their dreams well are likely to be Ones for whom sleep is like an elusive fairy tale. Perhaps dreams, then, are a sort of evolutionary consolation prize for the partially insomniatic. Perhaps they have been burdened with this curse of wakefulness because their dreams are portents of a world that must not be forgotten.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One may never know.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret Allen wasn&rsquo;t worried much about her dreams. This was because she was more concerned with trying not to get soaked by the downpour she found herself in. Lightning split the sky as she pulled her raincoat tighter around her. She splashed through a puddle as she jogged down the dark alleyway. Puddles and dark alleys just naturally seem to go together, like lightning glinting off a mysterious yet obtrusively nondescript metallic door hiding in plain sight alongside them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret pounded on the door. She didn&rsquo;t need to say the password - they were expecting her. Passwords were really more of a formality, anyway. Everyone knew who was meant to be there. The door was pulled open with the rather evocative sound of a big rusty metal door scraping against concrete. Margaret squeezed inside, dripping on the wet floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She made her way to the back of the chamber. She left her raincoat on. Being a modern raincoat, it created a system of equilibrium where even though you ended up essentially just as soaking wet as if you had not been wearing it, you at least couldn&rsquo;t tell just how wet you were because it was being held in by some sort of space-age plastic material with &ldquo;tex&rdquo; or &ldquo;lon&rdquo; in the name. For another thing, in dark mysterious chambers full of sinister cabals it just felt more appropriate to be wearing something with a hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting had already begun. Margaret was growing increasingly aware that she wasn&rsquo;t sure how she got there, or for that matter why. The room was thick with cigar smoke and arrogance, which it could be said are synonymous. A large crowd of gathered men were crowding the room, as a large crowd is want to do. They were standing generally in subservience to an imposing, cloaked figure sitting on a raised platform at the head of the chamber. That figure quieted the room with a few beats of its gavel, and then it spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said: &ldquo;This commences the meeting of the commercial and political interests in the city. Is every man here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A man in the gathered crowd responded. He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also here,&rdquo; concurred another man standing nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m -&rdquo; another man began, but the leader interrupted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said.&rdquo; Obviously every man here is here. What about the men who are not here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he who is not here should let us know that he is not here,&rdquo; chimed in one of the helpful subordinates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; responded the leader again. &ldquo;Point of order - in future meetings any brothers who are not here should let the rest of us know that he is not here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That solves the issue for future meetings,&rdquo; responded one of the men, who looked like the sort of man who liked pointing out problems to everyone. &ldquo;What about tonight?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; said the leader, somewhat deflated. &ldquo;Well, brothers, look around you. Do you see any man missing tonight?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, good idea,&rdquo; said one of the obvious brownnosers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd all spent a few moments looking around at each other. There was much mumbling and grumbling of things throughout the chamber. A few hoods were thrown off as men learned how generally impractical hoods were in dark rooms. Margaret, for her part, made a show of checking her neighbors, though in her case it was more out of confusion than to make roll call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, a call to action rose through the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where is Brother Matthew?!&rdquo; exclaimed a member of the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Matthew isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He should have let us know!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Does any man know where Brother Matthew is?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; called out Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We thought you weren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; the Leader said over the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; clarified Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd resumed the grumbling and mumbling, muddling their way through this improvised attendance check. It&rsquo;s a seldom considered problem that maintaining a satisfactory evaluation of attendance has been the bane of secret cabals through the centuries. It&rsquo;s all well and good to have dreams of world domination, corporate takeovers, or fixing your local tee-ball league, but sinister schemes are often thwarted before they begin by the simple matter of understanding who is and is not onboard. It&rsquo;s not exactly like the members can just broadcast their attendance on Twitter. What&rsquo;s the point of being a secret society if everybody is going to know about it? On the other hand, every missing member unaccounted for could be off forming their own secret counter-cabal, to fix the tee-ball games against you. The conspiracies you fight for are often made or broken on keeping track of your co-conspirators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where is Brother Gregory?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new outcry snapped everyone out of their mumbly reverie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory isn&rsquo;t here either!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory,&rdquo; the Leader called, &ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A general murmured call for Brother Gregory spread through the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the Leader concluded. &ldquo;Let the record show that Brother Gregory is also not here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the chief brownnoser tentatively interceded. &ldquo;Who has the record?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory has the record!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He really should have notified us that he wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the chief brownnoser interceded again. &ldquo;Does any man know where Brother Gregory is?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Gregory had a business trip this week, did he not?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General murmurs of agreement went up throughout the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There we are then,&rdquo; said the Leader, lifting his gavel in a conclusive sort of way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided. Brother Gregory is-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, wait, my mistake. That was Brother Michael.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the Leader, setting his gavel back down in a disappointed sort of way. &ldquo;Wait, Brother Michael isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much can be said about what happens when men gather in large groups. It is rather well established that, on the whole, the intelligence of man is inversely proportional to the number of men gathered with him. A gathering of men become decidedly less skilled in a number of areas than any given man on his own, particularly concerning willpower, logic, and attendance gathering. However, murmuring is one thing a group can do much better than any individual. It could be observed that any group of men is primarily just waiting for an excuse to strike up a good murmur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good murmur was struck in pursuit of Brother Michael.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He really should have let us know-&rdquo; began someone in the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He did let us know!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the Leader. &ldquo;But why did nobody notice that he isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; chimed in Brother Matthew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well speak up next time,&rdquo; the Leader chided, eagerly fetching his gavel up once again. &ldquo;Let the record show-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We don&#039;t have the record.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; the much deflated leader continued. &ldquo;You. Brother Stephen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I propose we appoint you-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is this a point of order?&rdquo; The chief brownnoser asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Leader replied, suddenly perking up. Points of order usually implied impending gavellings. &ldquo;Point of order! I propose we elect Brother Stephen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Seconded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We elect Brother Stephen &lsquo;Official Keeper of the Things We are to Add to the Record when We Find Brother Gregory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;All for say &#039;aye.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Leader continued, gavel hand positively trembling with anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group generally murmured an &ldquo;aye.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Opposed?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group generally murmured a &ldquo;nay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe the &#039;ayes&rsquo; have it,&rdquo; the Leader said, arm lifting his precious wooden hammer into the air triumphantly. &ldquo;Let the record show -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we find Brother Gregory.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let the Things We are to Add to the Record show.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Seconded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That we are to appoint Brother Stephen as the official Keeper of aforesaid Things we are to etcetera, etcetera.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gavel collided with the Leader&rsquo;s podium with a rather anticlimactic thud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now then, onto old business,&rdquo; the Leader continued. Suddenly, another man entered the chamber, a stack of pizza boxes held aloft. They were surprisingly dry, considering the downpour that Margaret braved earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, Brothers,&rdquo; the new man cheered. &ldquo;The pizza is here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; the brownnoser added rather smugly. &ldquo;I remember where Brother Gregory went.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Point of order,&rdquo; another man added rather hungrily. &ldquo;I propose we eat pizza now before moving on to old business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd began to swarm Brother Gregory and the pizza. Interest in pizza is another trait that is increased in relation to the size of a group. Ready availability of high quantities of pizza can probably also be attributed to the general decline in the success of sinister cabals in modern history. This cabal, having managed to brave the storm that is accounting for missing members, was clearly unable to best the challenge of thinking clearly in the presence of a hot, fresh slice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret was more confused than ever. Deep down she understood that she was there for a Very Important Reason. Deep down she knew she was invited, knew she paid her dues, and took her vow of fealty. She also knew she took the bus downtown, found the specific alley she had never in her life been to before, and that it was raining despite it being actually a rather nice day. She just couldn&rsquo;t specifically remember any of these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the curious thing about dreams. Everything makes sense until you actually think about them. When she woke up in her room just moments later, she couldn&rsquo;t help but take a few moments to reflect on what had been a strangely vivid and realistic experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting at this point that Margaret was not yet a witch. It is mostly worth mentioning by way of teasing the fact that this story will eventually include things like witches. That is not to say that stories about frustrated young women aren&rsquo;t perfectly worthwhile on their own without having to include fantastical nonsense to keep your attention. It&rsquo;s just that it should be clear that witches will feature rather prominently later on, so you should begin preparing yourself for that now. You likely don&rsquo;t need to prepare yourself for a story about frustrated young women because if you aren&rsquo;t one yourself you will certainly encounter them every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she was not yet a witch, then, Margaret Allen didn&rsquo;t put much stock in the strange dream she had that night. She didn&rsquo;t take it, as she perhaps should have, as a harbinger of the unprecedented adventure she was on the cusp of tumbling out of control into. She had no way of knowing at the time that the secret cabal she had witnessed was a Real Thing, and the meeting she was observing had actually transpired exactly as she had seen it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She didn&rsquo;t know she had a prophetic vision. How could she?</p>\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "<p><em>Much has been said about Witches. It would be foolish to think this was entirely by their design. It would also be rather foolish to assume this has been entirely to their benefit. However, the monumental position that Witches have in human culture is largely by their design, and it has largely been to their benefit. The stories you may have heard about witches throughout history, in that clever way that old stories often find a way of being, are entirely true. They are also, in that mundane, disappointing way that reality always imposes on things, entirely works of fiction.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The secret that every good Witch knows is this: Fiction and Reality are not mutually exclusive.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The fact remains that a Witch is in every way exactly what you would expect her to be, while at any moment capable of things you would never expect her to do.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith Araneus Midnight looked down at the spell she had constructed and took a deep breath. She grinned softly to herself. She rarely smiled, more rarely still in public, but she had the sort of smile that was clearly not a good sign. She had a smile that was most definitely at someone else&rsquo;s expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Lilith&rsquo;s smile, she was not born with her name. Her original name has been lost to history, or at least to the very definite impression that she will make suffer anyone who might try to sneak a glance at her passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like the Witch herself, names are fluid things. Lilith had decided at a young age that her name could be whatever she wanted it to be, and so she chose something that would suit the image she wanted to present for herself - Lilith Greene. A few years later, when she was at a slightly less young age, she decided she wasn&rsquo;t going to be a botanist and changed her name again. She eventually discovered her true passion - being generally terrifying - and so her image and name settled on their ultimate forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is here that any description might feel the need to resort to vapid, flowery language about Lilith&rsquo;s appearance. Though she did, as it happens, have on her person the various female body parts usually described with words like &ldquo;lithe&rdquo; and &ldquo;supple,&rdquo; it would be an insult to her to limit a description to that which she has in common with most other humans. She could, indeed, use her femininity to her advantage when she needed. However, when someone appears in a big, dark cloak, silhouetted against some lightning as they cackle maniacally into the night, onlookers don&rsquo;t usually concern themselves with how gracefully that person&rsquo;s hips will sway. Beauty is, of course, only skin deep. Power was always more important to her, and power coursed through her blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her spell that night had been well made - perhaps her best yet. The quality of work wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, of course. She had been practicing for quite a long time. Oneiromancy was a very difficult and subtle art. The trick was finding the right scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had started, many years ago, trying to manipulate world events as a whole. This proved fruitless, as working at that sort of scale would require much more power than even Lilith had. The trick, she realized, was thinking small. Act locally, think locally-er. It is easy to manipulate individuals, to gently guide them down a path that you chose for them. The flow of events is like a river. You can&rsquo;t just change what direction the river flows, but if you add a few strategically placed trees upstream, the flow will be ever-so-subtly affected. Over time the banks will begin to change. It would take time, but Lilith had plenty of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a tap on the window. A large black raven peered inside, his massive eye reflecting the crescent moon. It was Bodach, Lilith&rsquo;s familiar. At least, he was familiar to her. She called him her familiar in the same way that she called her sisters Agnes and Clarinda her &ldquo;colleagues.&rdquo; Bodach didn&rsquo;t speak to her - at least not in the way old fairy tales might suggest. He didn&rsquo;t transform or give her some mystical second sight. He wasn&rsquo;t magical at all. Bodey was simply Lilith&rsquo;s pet. Familiar just sounds so much more Witchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith had a deep fondness for ravens, as might be expected looking at her wardrobe. She appreciated the way their dark, mysterious quality supported her own. Bodach - this particular one, anyway - was the latest in a long line of birds all named Bodach lucky enough to win her favor. They were always ravens, they were always huge, and they were always male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She blew out a number of candles that were placed in a ceremonially important arrangement on the floor, and then strode to the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bodey,&rdquo; she said sweetly as she opened the window. If anyone knew she spoke to animals in such a gentle way she would quickly make sure they didn&rsquo;t know for long. &ldquo;What have you brought me this evening?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been nice if she could convince her familiars to bring her useful things. At the end of the day, however, they were always just ravens. Ravens have a habit of picking up random bits of falderal that they find interesting. Usually the things they find interesting are things that another person had thrown away. Often those things were in varying levels of decomposition. More than once it was a cigarette butt. Lilith added their less toxic offerings to a little altar, which over the years had become a massive piece of terrifyingly unwieldy folk art. Lilith liked to think it was full of the energy of those who hand handled the components through the years. An onlooker might assume it was full of disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodey tilted his head, a stretch of red ribbon dangling from his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly little boy,&rdquo; Lilith continued, taking the ribbon. &ldquo;You know your mistress so well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scratched his head, and he closed his eyes and nuzzled into her fingers affectionately. She tied the ribbon loosely around one of her necklaces, and it hung between her collarbones like an open wound. Perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lilith&rsquo;s wardrobe was almost entirely black. It was not quite entirely black simply because a few bright red accents always go a very long way in the symbolism department. Likewise, the grey streak in her hair seemed to serve simply as a sinister taunt, inviting any poor unfortunate passerby to question her age even for a moment. She was never seen without a number of rings and necklaces - every single one was worn for a very specific purpose, and almost all of them were adorned with images of death. She had the fashion sense of someone who cared very much about coming across like she didn&rsquo;t care at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak thoughtfully. His lithe, supple feet hopped onto the windowsill, and he eyed Lilith in a rather hungry sort of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Typical man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Always expecting something in return.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood up and retrieved a bowl she had been using in her spell. One convenient thing about having a Raven familiar is that they like to eat a number of the more perishable spell ingredients, so it added a bit of synergy to the whole operation. Oneiromancy had an unpleasant need for small rodent parts, but luckily Bodach considered them a delicacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other important task that Bodach performed for Lilith was as the proverbial whipping boy for her general opinions on the world. This was the main reason it was important for Bodach to be male.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said, stroking his black feathers. &ldquo;Get fat and lazy and then leave.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bocachs through the years have had the important responsibility of bearing a great deal of avarice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood and began tidying up the space, putting - or throwing - the spell ingredients away as necessary. Bodach watched her, trained to enjoy the sound of her voice. To him her presence implied affection and the possibility of further treats. He had imprinted on her some sense of avian social obligation. If he had known the real meaning of the words she said to him, he might have felt differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps that is why her raven relationships always worked. She understood the machinations of avian social structures, perhaps better than she understood the human counterparts. She slung insulting aphorisms at him because he was an impartial, friendly ear. Her words didn&rsquo;t need to be understood. The important thing was that he never tried to argue with her. He always listened sweetly, intently, and then left her alone so he could find another piece of garbage to give her. In turn, she kept him warm, gave him whatever sense of purpose a raven requires, and filled him up with all the small rodent parts he could handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are very close, Bodey,&rdquo; she was saying, organizing the bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling around her. &ldquo;It might even be a matter of months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach clicked his beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe my sisters are coming around. They aren&rsquo;t stupid men like you, so it has taken time to convince them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach shook his tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not long now, you fool. You useless little creature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodach ruffled his beak under one of his wings. From the corner of his eye, he noticed some movement in a nearby tree outside. He spread his wings and gracefully lept from the windowsill. She let him go. He was her pet, but he didn&rsquo;t live with her. She had realized many Bodachs ago that though it was quite difficult to get a raven to be a pet - it was impossible to get one to be a house pet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So very soon,&rdquo; she said to herself now. &ldquo;Then your kind will be no more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She closed the window.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Diana Harbinger yawned as she read through them. It was nothing she hadn&rsquo;t seen a hundred times before. She tipped the last few drops of coffee from her cup onto her tongue, and sighed. When she first started writing for PopCultural, Diana found something strangely exciting about the wall of hate spewed anonymously at her after each new article. After a few years of it, though, it was starting to feel like a cliche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many people, someone saying that they are going to be posting pictures of their mutilated corpse on the internet in the morning would be cause for alarm. For Diana, it was Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s editor regularly called her to make sure she was okay, which was a gesture she appreciated but didn&rsquo;t need. He kept offering to ban some of the more vicious regulars, but he ultimately relented when she pointed out that the absurd drama was always good for ad sales. She found something exciting about the attention. She felt like she was doing something important by bringing these voices out into the light. She also really enjoyed making fun of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana always loved giving people the finger, and the more they deserved it the more satisfaction she got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few blocks away, at a small, ancient diner, Evelyn Bailey was also yawning. She patiently awaited the end of her shift. A Thursday afternoon was not exactly a peak time, so the place was very quiet and almost deserted. It was a greasy spoon diner, though, so a few folks could be expected as a matter of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the counter sat an old man whose name everybody knew (in fact, everyone thought they knew his name, but they all thought it was something different and they were all wrong). He never spoke, but he was always there. Everyone knew what he ordered because it was the same thing he always ordered, and at this point serving him became as regular as taking out the garbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chef - a large man with a name like Sal - was constantly occupied with the work of making it seem like the work of a greasy spoon cook was in fact the hardest job in the world. In some ways he wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but in much more realistic ways the overworked and underpaid waitresses who had to serve his greasy abominations had it much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He understood this, though, and so he did look out for his sisters in arms on the front lines of the quick service dining industry. They had the usual methods of recourse against those customers who made their lives difficult. Various innocuous-seeming code phrases on order tickets let the cook know what particular customers deserved. Known bad tippers had their signal, and handsy old men got theirs. Sal had little patience for disrespectful people in general, but he had even less patience for anyone who would make trouble for the people he had to work very long hours with. Revenge was a dish best served at the lukewarm temperature that everything served at a diner ends up being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around this time, Margaret Allen - fully awake this time - was trying to get her computer to cooperate. She was telling what she was supposed to tell it to get it to do what she wanted it to do. It just wasn&rsquo;t doing it. Her firm had upgraded their design software earlier in the month, and a few of her favorite shortcuts had changed. She sighed to herself. She had only just gotten used to the new shortcuts after the last update. Things that work shouldn&rsquo;t change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She flicked the little rocking desk toy she kept near her keyboard. Unlike her stupid computer, it always worked. It was a pair of little wire figures balanced on either end of an armature, like two very skinny people sharing a seesaw. When flicked, the perfectly balanced figures rocked back and forth for a surprisingly long time. It was rather satisfying to watch them go, and counting the rocks helped her clear her mind. The record so far was two hundred forty eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toy was positioned rather specifically, as was everything on her desk. It was a rather sacred space to her, as she made very clear to her coworkers. Once an intern at the firm needed some clear tape, and found Margaret&rsquo;s dispenser (two inches left of her left monitor stand, just behind her stack of post-its, tape pointing to the left). She returned it almost immediately, placing it between Margaret&rsquo;s post-its and her coffee mug. Several strongly-worded emails later, and it was determined that nobody in the office was to touch anything on her desk unless lives depended on it. She would have preferred dropping even that provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the general rules of literature that an author never names a character something like &ldquo;Dickweed.&rdquo; It skews the character, and it forces readers to form opinions about them before they get to do anything. It is especially egregious in a script. An actor loses a great deal of freedom when they get a character simply referred to as &ldquo;asshole.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with full awareness of this rule that the next character will only be referred to as Dickweed Barista, because that tells you everything you need to know about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diana&rsquo;s hands were hovering over her keyboard to write a response to the comment she had just read. Before she could get very far, the music she was listening to was cut out. She was suddenly snapped back to the world of one of the city&rsquo;s many coffee shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dickweed Barista stood over Diana with a sickeningly friendly smile, one of her earbuds pinched between his finger and thumb. She stared at him, trying to come to grips with the situation, and just how violent she should be in response. The wails of Bikini Kill could still be heard coming from the little nub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything, honey?&rdquo; He asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; She muttered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classic rock played innocuously as Evelyn looked up at the clock on the wall of the diner. The clock&rsquo;s hands were barely visible through glass that had been frosted by decades of grime. Evelyn generally tried to avoid looking at the clock, because beneath all those layers of old grease, those hands somehow moved slower than normal clocks. Surrounding the clock was scores of junk, exactly the sort of junk that seems to just grow naturally on the walls of old diners. The ceiling was stained from cigarette smoke, despite the fact that cigarettes had been banned inside the place for over a decade. The whole place used to be mostly white, but at this point it was getting hard to tell. The white had given way over the decades to the greys, browns, and beiges that always follow in the wake of human society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn spent more time in this grimy place than her own home, but it was her domain. She was the duchess of grease, and the diner was for all intents and purposes hers. Technically, her name wasn&rsquo;t on the door (that said &ldquo;Marcie&rsquo;s&rdquo;), her name wasn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s paycheck (except her own, of course), and she had little real authority. What she had was the authority of tenure, and the determination of someone who was far too tired to deal with any of bullshit. She knew how things worked, and made sure they continued to even though it wasn&rsquo;t what she was paid to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had collected the meager tips on her last table of the day when she heard a familiar voice. It was familiar in the way a chronic, stabbing pain is familiar. The trouble with being a longstanding waitress at a cheap restaurant (if you had to pick just one) was the occasional unbearable regular. This particular regular was called Eddie, and he had a thing for Evelyn. Evelyn had a thing for him, as well, but it was a very different thing with the words &ldquo;pepper spray&rdquo; printed on the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, can I get some help over here?&rdquo; Eddie asked. She rolled her eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heh, just kidding,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You can take your time. I&#039;m enjoying the view.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olympic athletes would be impressed by the tone and strength of Evelyn&rsquo;s eye-rolling muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margie,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s desk neighbor, making her lose count of the rocking toy on her desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. He was a very short man, which always seemed like it confused him. He seemed to always gesturing at his stature, as if to say &ldquo;surely this is all some sort of mistake.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Margaret,&rdquo; she said in a way that suggested she had said it a hundred times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come take a look at these plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She scooted her meticulously adjusted office chair the few feet to his desk. Her desk toy continued rocking unmonitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble getting the clearance to work on this door,&rdquo; he said, pointing at some meaningful lines on his screen. He often needed her to do his work for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, see, you don&rsquo;t need a firewall there,&rdquo; she said, pointing at some different, but equally meaningful lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A firewall has to be self-supporting,&rdquo; she said, wondering if he even went to Architectural school. &ldquo;A fire barrier only has to go up to the roof deck. You&rsquo;ll have room for that other door there if you just use a barrier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he said, his brow furrowing obnoxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. The answer to the question, &lsquo;what if Napoleon were an architect, and also an idiot?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One time, Margaret got to work to find that <em>Greg</em> had moved everything on her desk an inch to the left. He did it as a prank. She didn&rsquo;t have to notice him stifling laughter to realize what had happened, mainly because she noticed her desk was off from the elevator. She tried getting back at him by changing all of his chair adjustments while he was in the bathroom. He didn&rsquo;t even notice. He just swung his stubby little legs that no longer reached the ground. It was infuriating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, Dee,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista, handing Diana her earbud and returning to tidying the table next to her. &ldquo;I was just wondering if you needed anything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Die.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My name. It&rsquo;s not Dee. It&rsquo;s Di.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dickweed responded with an unfortunate chuckle. &ldquo;I was just going by what was written on your cup.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked down at her cup, marked &lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; and sighed. She had been forced to explain to people how to pronounce her name her entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Die,&rsquo; you know, like what we&rsquo;re all going to do some day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are you concentrating on so hard, anyway?&rdquo; He responded, the not-so-subtle hints flying right over his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m working.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you write for Pop Cultural, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stared at him, knowing the large &lsquo;Pop Cultural&rsquo; sticker on her laptop was almost directly in his eye line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever gave you that idea?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Need anything else, Mike?&rdquo; Evelyn asked the Man at the Bar as she refilled his coffee. She knew the answer, but it was still her job to ask and she took any chance she could to put off the same old conversation she had fake smiled her way through a hundred times before. She walked over to the booth Eddie had manspread himself into, and flipped to a new page in her order pad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, Eddie, what&#039;ll it be today?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What, no specials?&rdquo; He asked with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t talking about food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you really want the specials?&rdquo; She responded, with the tone of someone who wasn&rsquo;t, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I just like hearing you talk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you just want your usual?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, you know me too well, Eve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&#039;s Evelyn, and I kind of hope not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Haha, nah.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m just finishing my shift, but I&#039;ll get this in for you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, maybe I&#039;ll just get this to go and we can hang out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn finished jotting down Eddie&rsquo;s order, and suppressed a wince. What she needed was a big couch, a big beer, and a big distance between her and any thirsty boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I, uh, have plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was true. She always had standing plans specifically to be not hanging out with Eddie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Eddie replied, trying and failing to look nonchalant about it, &ldquo;maybe next time. I want to make sure you get a tip, though. You know I tip well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just put it on your receipt when you pay, like usual,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret&rsquo;s boss, one of the partners of the firm, walked by <em>Greg&rsquo;s</em> desk looking over some papers. He was much taller than <em>Greg</em>, a fact that often amused Margaret while her mind wandered during tedious team meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;make sure you get that environmental impact report on the Northbrook project to me before you leave today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. There was a different fabric print on the inside, as if they were designed to be rolled up to his elbows. One arm was rolled slightly higher than the other. All of this was deeply troubling to Margaret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, I was just about to send that to you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; <em>Greg</em> chimed in, leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;I was thinking about that - there are definitely some simple ways to avoid some headaches on the plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yup, I-&rdquo; Margaret attempted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&#039;s a good idea, Greg,&rdquo; said their boss. &ldquo;I think we&#039;ll want to make sure we get that into the report. Margie -&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and send your findings to Greg so he can get that added in. Greg, you can get that to me next week some time. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>. At least he didn&rsquo;t have to stoop very low to reach the butts he kissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great work,&rdquo; said their boss with a smile. &ldquo;Have a great weekend, guys.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret sighed. She had been working on that report for two weeks. She had researched code requirements and survey reports on the site itself, and reconciled them with the needs of the client. That was, in her estimation, her job as an Architect, so it barely needed mentioning. However, considering <em>Greg</em>probably didn&rsquo;t even know what survey reports even were, she always felt the bar was pretty low (bonus height joke).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You should smile more,&rdquo; said Dickweed Barista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see you in here working all the time. You&#039;ll brighten my day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was enough for Diana. She slammed her laptop closed, and started collecting her things. A young woman out in public generally is going to get hit on, but she didn&rsquo;t have to like it. Diana had done as much as she could, covering herself in tattoos and piercings, occasionally even shaving her head, but still the idiots would come along with their suggestions for how she could be prettier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Listen, you&#039;re really not my type,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&#039;re probably into, like, artistic guys?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&#039;m not into guys at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh awesome,&rdquo; he said with a stupid grin. &ldquo;You&#039;re a lesbian? That&#039;s hot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ugh, you just lost your talking privileges.&rdquo; She said, visibly cringing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, I&#039;m just trying to be friendly, honey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#039;re doing a real shitty job, sport.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stormed out of the coffee shop, leaving Dickweed holding his hands out in confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret gave her desk toy a flick and started working on an email. At least she still knew the shortcuts to Outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='quote'>\r\n<p><em>Greg</em>,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attached is the document I have been working on for the last few weeks.

She stuck to the one thing she knew would make the idiots even more mad than just the fact she was a woman with an opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='quote'>\r\n<p>RE: Death to Diana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*your</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Posted by Diana Harbinger</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n",
