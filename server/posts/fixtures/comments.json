I mean, even recently, we went to your play and complimented it. I may have made some negative comments about the playwright and his pacing issues, but everything I said about the acting was very positive because the acting was very good. The only reason I made those comments about the script itself is because I wanted to share my honest opinion of the show with you because I respect you and I figured you&#039;d want to hear what I actually thought about it. I read lines with you the other day, I&#039;ve been raving about your work in 211 because, quite frankly, it&#039;s kicking the shit out of anything the rest of us are doing.\r\rI don&#039;t know what more you want from us. Maybe we aren&#039;t bending over backwards to compliment your website or laughing ourselves stupid over your techno remixes like your theatre friends do, but that doesn&#039;t mean that we don&#039;t respect you.\r\rI&#039;ve never in my life busted my ass to keep someone as a friend who didn&#039;t want me around and I&#039;m not about to start now. If you&#039;d rather hang out with your theatre friends then fine, go ahead and do it. Clearly you understand and respect them a lot more than you understand and respect us.\r\n\r\n",

First of all, the environments are amazing - equal to, if not better than, the characters.  And I doubt that it was Tyler&#039;s stroke of genious to show you in your natural habitat, i.e. the Vader suit.  I bet most of your regular, um, readers?  (what do you call losers, I mean, people who sit around reading other people&#039;s blogs, anyway?) don&#039;t realize that you are, in fact, always in that wretched suit.  He wears it to class, he wears it to meals, he sleeps in it (too bad it doesn&#039;t have built-in footies), and I&#039;m pretty sure he showers in it, too.  It&#039;s kind of like that special underwear Mormons are supposed to wear, only this suit hasn&#039;t been mandated by an actual diety, just by George Lucas and the company that makes clothing out of plastic.  It&#039;s weird, I tell you, weird.  Not like me - I never dress in strange clothing.  I happen to wear clothing that&#039;s perfectly reasonable and ordinary.  Like my work uniform - lots of people wear hand-sewn early 19th Century dresses, right?  Didn&#039;t I see Scott wearing something like that in an earlier post?  I KNOW Cameron looks great in a nice wool shortgown and skirt, and, let&#039;s face it, Neal could benefit from the uplifting support of a corset.  Not a black quilted plastic jumpsuit.

I&#039;d still rather play old RPGs on my PS1 than damn near anything that&#039;s out these days. I did have a short term addiction to Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within, but having beaten that in about 12 game hours there isn&#039;t much more to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\n11. Develop the story, develop the characters\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nGameplay is important I&#039;ll grant you, but I&#039;ve always played games (particularly RPGs, but even games like Grand Theft Auto) for the stories and the characters. A game is much more fulfilling if you&#039;ve spent 40+ hours guiding the path of characters that you&#039;ve become attached to on an emotional level. There aren&#039;t enough games out these days that try to deliver an original storyline with engaging characters. Even SquareEnix has been dropping the ball lately. I guess gaming companies haven&#039;t noticed that games like FF7 are still among the best sellers of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\n12. Replayability\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nWhat good is a game that I can beat in a few days and never want to play again? Ubisoft doesn&#039;t care because I&#039;ve already paid them (not really, but you get my point), but something makes me believe that they should. Give me good gameplay, a solid storyline, dynamic characters, and a game that I can play for 40+ hours and I&#039;m set. It&#039;s even better if I can play that game again. Take a lesson from Square: make the plot so ridiculously complicated that you have to play through it 4 or 5 times before you even know what the hell is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\n13. Graphics aren&#039;t worth shit if the game sucks\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not few people will buy a game just for the graphics. If the game isn&#039;t worth playing no amount of bump mapping is going to save it.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nBUMP!!!\r\n\r\n",

Let me quicksave, or count me out.\r\r\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just sick of games being ruined by the inability to quicksave.  Far Cry, Call of Duty 2, XIII, and Path of Neo are all based on autosave checkpoints.  Autosaves are fine for RPG&#039;s where you are less likely to have to fight a huge monster every single time you enter a new room, but action games absolutely require the ability to save the game anywhere.  Whithout it, when you get to a hard part, you have to replay the sequence leading up to it over and over and over until you finally beat the hard part.  In Far Cry, I was just so sick of replaying easy parts hundreds of times, I eventually just stopped playing it.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nLet me save it wherever I want.  There is no reason not to.\r\n\r\n",

Example: Diablo is an awesome game, lots of gamers everywhere love to play it over and over again, but all those games taht come out that are just like Diablo but a different format, everyone hates. I mean the game is exactly the same its just a different storyline, yet no one likes them. Now yes, copying other games is a good way to get your game not played, but because Diablo was a first of its kind, everyone loved it and play it all the time. \r\rNow I like Path of Neo, keyword there is liked. The game had lots of bugs and the gameplay was pretty bad, also the gun fighting was not to my satisfaction. But when I installed the game the only thing I was really looking for was some descent hand to hand combat and it following the movie fairly well. I got that and so I was happy enough to get past the bugs and gameplay(which by the way the combat is really not that bad once you get used to it). Also it was kinda worth it to play the scene where you fight all the Smiths, and the surprise ending was neat. \r\rOne last thing I&#039;d like to say. Gameplay completly dwarves graphics, yet graphics enhance gameplay. If you have a solid storyline and gameplay, then you got a good game hands down, even if its text based. That is a thing that I would think developers would get from testing in alpha and beta.\r\n\r\n",

I think you are bringing up a really good point to Shauvon, the industry is so money driven now a days. No one wants to make a good game that is really fun. I mean do you remember when they made Half-Life 2...it was completly about the game, they knew that money wouldn&#039;t be a problem if the game was absolutley amazing....I&#039;d like to see the profits from that game.                                                            Anyway, I think that the industry should be grabbed by the neck and given a wake up call. We need the new young minds to get in there. People that grew up making video games and know what people want. Now I dunno where I am gonna go when I graduate, but its a pretty good bet I&#039;ll be doing something with video games, whether its making video cards software, or designing computers, so I&#039;m gonna do my part to help the industry and raise its standards. We need smarter people that are high up and can make those big desicions about games! Remember! only you can prevent video game standard failure!\r\n\r\n",

I don&#039;t know why you chose to keep to yourself the other night, but I&#039;m sure that if you go back to trying to trying to enjoy yourself around us you won&#039;t have so many bad nights.\rWhat I don&#039;t understand is why you didn&#039;t say anything immediately when you had a problem.  You didn&#039;t suggest we find another place, you didn&#039;t tell us to stop for the night, and you definitely didn&#039;t let Mike know that he had to clean up.  You left the room and posted on your website that there was a problem, but you didn&#039;t tell any of us to our faces.  We (you, me, and Mike) need to sit down and talk about this instead of talking through your website.  Let&#039;s cut the passive-agressive bullshit and just talk to eachother.\r\n\r\n",

Given what you heard, you made the best decision you could.  I&#039;ll give you some more background, and you can tell me if your impression of the night changes any.  We don&#039;t drink that often.  Speaking for myself, I have been drunk 4 times in my life.\r\n\r\n\rWe were not using Shauvon for his room.  You might not realize this, but three people live in this room.  Two of them were drinking.\r\n\r\n\rChris doesn&#039;t normally give Shauvon crap about drinking at all.  What he meant (and couldn&#039;t say properly due to being drunk) is that if each weekend is worse exclusively because you don&#039;t drink, then you should look at the cause of each weekend being worse.\r\n\r\n\rWe don&#039;t drink because it&#039;s cool, we don&#039;t drink because that&#039;s the only way we can feel good, we don&#039;t drink alone, and we don&#039;t drink in the morning or dring the day.  We drink because it helps us loosen up after a long week.  It&#039;s how we stay balanced.  All work and no play, after all.  In other words, we&#039;re happy drunks.\r\n\r\n\rWe don&#039;t expect Shauvon to be designated puker-turner.  We don&#039;t expect him to do anything for or with us.  He&#039;s welcome to join us, he&#039;s welcome to drink with us, stay sober in our company, videotape us, or just be elsewhere.  Besides, he has never acted as designated puker-turner, so why should we expect it?  Shauvon just left when the room smelled bad.  I was the one who woke Mike and got him to clean up.\r\n\r\n\rWe expect only one thing from Shauvon: tell us when we&#039;re doing something he won&#039;t tolerate.  You might not realize this, but he never told us 'guys, you&#039;re too loud' or 'guys, the room smells bad' or 'guys, can you do this somewhere else?'  We can go to Chris&#039;s room if necessary.  We could have done so last night, but the idea was never suggested.\r\n\r\n",

It&#039;s your responsibility not to bother other people and to be in charge of your faculties enough to know when you&#039;re doing so.  Sounds to me as if you&#039;re doing a nifty little transference maneuver so that instead of looking at what you guys did to yourselves last night, you&#039;re now looking at what Shauvon has done as if he is somehow at fault.  Why are you making your behavior someone else&#039;s problem?  Talking is a good idea, guys, but it only works if you are willing to spend at least half the time listening.\r\n\r\n",

I would have gladly listened to Shauivon&#039;s concerns, had he voiced them.  I would have even spoken for him if he didn&#039;t want to address our group alone.  This whole situation could have been averted.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\rI&#039;m not saying that we should be allowed to drink in the room.  One of the points that Shauvon missed (and should have used) is that he is equally guilty as the rest of us if we are caught with alcohol in the room, unless he&#039;s the one turning us in.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying that Shauvon&#039;s concerns about inebriation are without merit.  Alcoholism is a real problem for many people, and Shauvon had to watch others dear to him suffer because of that problem.\r\n\r\n\rI&#039;m not saying that Shauvon is responsible for our actions.  What kind of lunacy is that?  He wasn&#039;t even there.  How could he be responsible?  No one is responsible for the entire group.  Each person is responsible for his own actions.  At the same time, don&#039;t blame the group for the actions of an induvidual.  I&#039;m just glad that Mike didn&#039;t choke and we didn&#039;t have to call an ambulance.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\rI rarely drink, and when I do, I watch how much I have.  I had my 'way too much' time last Fall, and I vowed not to repeat that episode because it was embarassing for me and disgusting and oppressive for everyone else.  I know my limits, and I don&#039;t push it.  I can even enjoy myself without alcohol, but I like to occasionally get 'buzzed' for a few hours.  Everything in moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\rEnough of this.  I&#039;ve been over this before.  Let&#039;s stop ranting on the website and sit down to discuss this like adults.  I find it immature that we can&#039;t face each other and say what needs to be said.  I suppose I&#039;m no better, since I&#039;m posting here, too.  This will be my last.  If any of you want to discuss this further, you know where to find me.\r\n\r\n",

Anyone who has known Shauvon for two years and is really suprised to hear that he is uncomfortable with the people around him getting drunk has not made much of an effort to really get to know him.\r\r2).  Many, many, many, many people of all ages have not been drunk 10 times in their entire lifetimes.  But it&#039;s clear that I shouldn&#039;t pick on Chris anymore.  He clearly has enough problems without me adding to them.\r\r3).  It&#039;s true that I don&#039;t know you boys well, but the fact is, I don&#039;t have to know you to appraise the situation.  The fact is, I only have to know one thing:  each of you are willing to break the law/campus rules to please yourselves.  It is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to consume alcohol.  Period.  Many people make it to the age of 21 without breaking that law.  I don&#039;t know why so many people can&#039;t, but frankly, I don&#039;t care.  If you think the law is unjust, you should work to change it, not blantantly break it.  What is more, it is clearly stated that drinking is not permitted in the dorms at Purdue, no matter what your age might be.  If you don&#039;t wish to abide by that rule, you should not live in the dorms.  It doesn&#039;t matter if Shauvon condones it or not.  Those are the rules you agreed to live by.\r\n\r\n",

There are plenty of people who mindlessly reject the mainstream lifestyle, especially in their physical appearance, but conforming with non-conformists sounds suspiciously like conformity to me.

If I was gearing up for war, I&#039;d be pulling the financial plug, threatening reprisals, and pushing Shauvon&#039;s emotional buttons.  Instead, I just made a few observations which he is free to accept or reject as he pleases.  My point was and is a general one, addressing the real definition of non-conformity.  (I agree with the post that urges more philosophical dialogue and less cringing angst.)  Here&#039;s the thing:  Shauvon has always insisted he hates having everyone make comments about his height, claiming that it makes him feel self-concious and freaky.  Then he turns around and does something to modify his appearance which basically adds about five more feet to his height--in other words, he now stands out more than ever.  I think, at the very least, he&#039;s forfeited the right to complain about people gawking or making comments about his appearance.  And while it&#039;s true that this new look is hardly a permanent alteration and Shauvon&#039;s appearance is, of course, his to do with what he likes, as someone who cares about him, I have to question whether there isn&#039;t some sort of self-destructive mechanism at work here.  He doesn&#039;t like being treated like a freak, so he makes himself more freakish.  Hmmmmm.  Of course, it&#039;s hard for me to relate to anyone who spends lots of time fussing over how they look, whether they&#039;re trying to look like a movie star or a freak.  Outward appearance is only a manifestation, and I think most people would be happier with themselves if they spent more time working on what&#039;s inside and less time primping in front of a mirror.  But that&#039;s just my opinion.  Oh, and my name isn&#039;t really Mom.  That, too, is only a manifestation.\r\n\r\n",

I am forced to miss Crazy Monkey shows because I have to go to Winter&#039;s Tale practice, which involves sitting in a hallway alone for four hours waiting to appear on stage for three minutes to say  two lines.  My camera does not work at all, so although I spent $350 over the summer to be able to take pictures of things, I can&#039;t.  I am completely self conscious about my body.  I have so many neuroses about food that it  sometimes makes me nauseous just to look at it.  Society has crumbled into this terrifying, money-obsessed, conservative, creativity crushing monster, and there is no way to escape the fact that I will have to become part of it some day.  People constantly point out traits about me that I have absolutely no control over.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nEverything around me is out of my control, so it is important for me to be able to know that I am in control of something.  I can look in a mirror and say, I&#039;m not putting up with this anymore.  I don&#039;t have to put up with it anymore.  I never did, nobody ever does.  It sounds ridiculous, but it gives me hope in the future.  If I can cut my hair and completely change the way I look, maybe all of those other things can change, too.  Even if that means just accepting things.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself offended or concerned or otherwise effected by something as trivial as a haircut, maybe you need to look at dealing with some of your own concerns about control.  Everyone needs to accept that there are things outside their grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nOne more thing.  Peter, I&#039;m a sophomore.\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "Is shauvon denying conformity or conforming to non-conformity? That&#039;s probably a question only Shauvon really knows the answer to, but I&#039;m pretty sure when you consciously decide to deny conformity, it sorta defeats the point. One should be more focused on being his or herself and the word &#039;conformity&#039; should never even enter the picture. So basically what I&#039;m getting at is that this is A) a sweet haircut B) something that everyone is reading wayyyyyyyy too much into and C) probably the least big deal of things that someone could do to their body. He didn&#039;t get a tatoo or a piercing. He cut some hair, which will majestically rise once again like a phoenix from the ashes in a matter of a few weeks. No harm done! And some jobs see haircuts like that as a benefit. Just not the soul-sucking, mindless, corporate-driven ones, which, unfortunately, are usually the best-paying. I&#039;m just saying that there are options. And Shauvon, we usually eat dinner at around 5 every day. IM me if you&#039;d ever care to join. We are very accepting of all creeds, colors, religions, beliefs, and haircuts. Especially tri-hawks.\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "To Shauvon&#039;s mother, \r\rWell put. But on one hand you&#039;re saying that it is simply an outward appearance which is not as important as the inner self. This is all true. But then you say that this concerns you because it might be indictative of some deeper inner conflict in Shauvon. So then this isn&#039;t *just* a physical appearance thing anymore. Assigning psychological quirks or strengths to one&#039;s clothing or haircut is an almost purely subjective and arbitrary practice. While you may be concerned that a certain haircut might be signs of inner pain, I might think that a certain haircut is a sign of newfound inner strength and independence. It&#039;s a useless practice to get into.\r\rAs far as the definition of denying conformity goes, there are many many ways one can deny conformity. There is the type of conformity denial you speak of, the inner one where one sticks to one&#039;s beliefs in the face of adversity. This is probably the best and most valuable kind, but it is not the *only* kind. There is also the physical conformities. People dress a certain way to fit it, some young girls won&#039;t eat in order to conform to an ideal body type, there is a standard outward appearance that people conform too which Shauvon has choosen to deny. Voila! Conformity, consider yourself denied!\r\rSaying your name is 'mom' was a joke, I hope you don&#039;t think I was being disresctful, that is really really not how I meant to come off as. Every post I&#039;ve read from you is very intelligent and articulate, so I object with a great deal of respect.\r\rShauvon, if you&#039;re a sophmore, then how come I just met you this year? MMMMMMMM?!?!?!?! Trickster! Just kidding. Won&#039;t make that mistake again, sorry.\r\n\r\n",

To me, that spells about the first half of denying conformity.  As for it making him stand out more, it is something different for people to identify him, apart from 'mile high Shauvon,' and we all know that has nothing to do with his mid flight activities.\r\rAlso, I am a huge proponent of doing ridiculous things with what you have, while you still have them.  Hair is something that not all men are going to be able to keep, and you can&#039;t always predict if you&#039;re going to lose it!  Luckily, it continues to replace itself, but only for a limited time!\r\rGentlemen, I implore you: DO SOMETHING STRANGE WITH YOUR HAIR!

Anyone who resorts to yelling is already out of control, so you were wise to back away slowly, the same way you would get away from a snarling, snapping dog.

I wanted to say this to you because I think you have a great chance to make a definite success in the theatre department in the future. I hope that someday you can be excited about an opening night even if your only in 10 seconds of a play. It&#039;s sometimes disconcerting to read that you feel like the role you received was not up to what you think you deserve. Instead of focusing on the size of your role, you could see how lucky you were that you were cast in Jeff&#039;s last show at Purdue. Some seniors, who have spent four years studying theatre here have never gotten the chance to work with him and would trade places with you in a split second. \rThis isn&#039;t at all supposed come across as a negative view of your focus or work on the show. I think you are doing a great job and your stage presence is wonderful. I just hope you see what you have been given, or if that doesn&#039;t work, see what others have not been given. \rAnyways, from my experience, itâ€™s the grateful and humble that get far in the department. Others (especially designers) pay more attention to those who truly do their work for the art and not for the 15 (or 10) minutes of fame. \rI guess all I am saying is, I hope you love this, all of this as much as some of us do. Itâ€™s the challenging, complicated and sometimes unpleasant work which makes the performance process truly exciting, at least in my opinion. \r\rAnd thatâ€™s just my opinion, so take it or leave it. But thatâ€™s all.\rBreak all the legs in the house during Winterâ€™s Tale. :)\r\rCaitlin Mick\r\n\r\n",

I understand that he&#039;s not happy, but it&#039;s nobody&#039;s fault but his own and constantly blaming his unhappiness on the random actions of drunken frat boys is getting a little old.

Maybe by the time you&#039;ve gotten your degree and been to a few more frat parties, you&#039;ll understand such subtle nuances.\r\rI think you also may have mistaken 'arguing' for spouting off and shutting down.  Again, it can be tricky for those of us who aren&#039;t particularly interested in learning or growing or participating in social interplay to recognize the differences, but, please, benefit from my few extra years of experience - there are actually differences between thoughtful engagement with the wide world around you and braying like a jackass.\r\rAnd perhaps - and this is just a suggestion, here - no need to take it personally - you might want to also check a dictionary and a mirror to bolster your understanding of the terms 'hypocrite,' 'ridiculous' (however you choose to spell it), and 'anti-social.'  Oh, and I&#039;d be willing to bet that your haricut might not pass muster on any number of makeover shows you might currently be watching on Lifetime on Shauvon&#039;s television.\r\rJust some friendly observations - I hope you&#039;re enjoying all of those many things you have to do with your time.  I look forward to reading and learning from the wisdom of your future musings on the way things should be.\r\n\r\n",

All you are getting is one side of the argument consistently delivered by the sniveling drama queen.\r\r\r\n\r\nBy the way Shauvon, it&#039;s impressive that you can actually, with a straight face, mock somebody else&#039;s major after dropping out of one of the easiest departments at this school because it was too much work for you.\r\r\r\n\r\nAnd Aili, if my life ever becomes so sad that I&#039;m taking personal or career advice from a mid-20&#039;s waitress at a comedy club then I will have reached and surpassed the point at which your limited life experience will be able to help me. I don&#039;t know why every argument you make has to come down to alcoholism, but as I understand it Shauvon&#039;s new theatre friends drink as much if not more than we do. I think your issues with alcohol are much more significant than any of our&#039;s are.\r\r\r\n\r\nMy point in this entire argument though is not to aim cheap shots at the people that choose to argue with me. My point is to question Shauvon&#039;s right to belittle others. He has spent a lot of time while I&#039;ve known him talking about how people shouldn&#039;t be stupid and asinine. He&#039;s spent even more time talking about how much he hates it when people insult and belittle him. What does i\r\n\r\n",

Maybe if Shauvon wasn&#039;t so ridiculously insecure he&#039;d be able to live by his own supposed ideals. I think I understand the meaning of 'hypocrisy' just fine. Perhaps you are the one that needs a lesson in definitions.\r\r\r\n\r\nOne more small point Shauvon, you can&#039;t be a non-conformist and then spout off repeatedly about how stupid people are when they think that particular laws are unfair and stupid. You know what&#039;s interesting? America is the only country with significant problems with alcoholism and drunk driving. You want to know why? Of course you don&#039;t, but I&#039;m going to tell you anyway. Because of the sheltered and puritan way that people are brought up in this country alcohol is hailed as taboo for anybody who is under 21. Apparently once you reach that age you are entirely responsible and are thus no longer at fault if you choose to engage in consumption of alcohol. In France, where kids start drinking with their parents at a young age there is virtually no drunk driving and basically no alcoholism because drinking isn&#039;t a big deal to them. It&#039;s people like you that make drinking such a problem in this country. Yes, we engage in the occasional drink because we enjoy it. We don&#039;t do it to a self-destructive level nor do we do it very often. As I&#039;ve said, I&#039;m averaging less than once a month right now so I don&#039;t know how you could even possibly think that I have a problem. I think it&#039;s absolutely ludicrous that the drinking age in this country is 21. We can go to war for our country at 18, but we can&#039;t have alcohol? It&#039;s stupid. I understand that underage drinking is illegal, but I don&#039;t really care. If I get caught then I will accept the consequences of my behavior, but the threat of being caught is not enough to detour me from engaging in activities that I enjoy that are not illegal for any good reason. Unlike you, I don&#039;t blindly \r\n\r\n",

Thanks to you, I see now that all of those geneticists, psychologists, and chemists are totally wrong. And I can&#039;t WAIT until you move to France. Just imagine all of the insights you&#039;ll bring us across the annonymous leagues of cyberspace then! Be still, my heart! I&#039;ll bet you&#039;ll absolutely love it there, what with all the rioting and burning cars and hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised white boys with no jobs & lots of wine, and no unfair, nonsensical, discriminating laws at all. I can hardly wait, oh Sagacious one, for what deep and meaningful insights you&#039;ll impart next, between your highly pressing social & professional engagements, of course.

Facts, rather than ill-stated opinion, heresay, and propoganda tend to work best in an argument.\r\r\r\n\r\nThat said here are some facts for you: the vast majority of doctors actually recommend having a drink or two every day as it lowers blood pressure and decreases your risk for heart disease. Also, most doctors and nearly all psychologists agree that alcoholism is not a chemical dependency; it is, in fact, a means of self-gratification meant to mask other emotional issues. Consequently, no geneticists that I&#039;ve ever heard of has claimed that alcoholism is an inherited disease because it stems from lack of self-esteem and not anything physical or chemical.\r\r\r\n\r\nNow that I&#039;ve said all that I&#039;m sure you&#039;re going to say something about how I have low self-esteem and that I just proved your argument, but all you&#039;ll succeed in doing is proving my theory that you just sit down at your computer and pour out a bunch of crap without actually responding to any of my talking points. As I&#039;ve said many times before I am not an alcoholic by any description of the word, nor am I nearly the 'angry, disenfranchised, self-important, lonely, lost little white boy' that your brother is. I&#039;m genuinely curious to see how long you can go in this argument without saying anything interesting or original without pointlessly repeating yourself to no logical end.\r\n\r\n",

You&#039;ve really taught me something valuable about arguing: when somebody doesn&#039;t have something legitimate to say chances are they will just question your sexuality in an effort to unnerve you and then disappear into the unimaginably huge black hole that is the internet.\r\r\r\n\r\nNot that I really care what you think, but I&#039;m not gay and have had a wealth of relationship and sexual experience. I don&#039;t where I indicated that I was stressed in anyway. I have two projects to finish and my year is done, most of my finals don&#039;t even matter. You must be stressed about being such a miserable failure just in general, but I, being the good person that I am, wouldn&#039;t call attention to the fact that you&#039;ve done nothing productive with the 'education' that you received.\r\r\r\n\r\nOk, your first article: the most recent study referenced is 8 years old and the entire thing talks about ethanol, which is only a component of some types of alcoholic beverages. Beer, for instance, doesn&#039;t contain ethanol. Also, your article proves pretty conclusively that there are no firm findings to support either of our claims, but I guess if you can&#039;t prove your own point you might as well nullify both of our&#039;s. That article is also from a site that openly supports the '12 step' program which has been conclusively proven to be completely useless (they have an impressive %5 success rate). Basically you should probably check the validity of your sources. I could go on the internet and find a 'paper' by a 'doctor' that says just about anything I want it to... or I could write my own.\r\r\r\n\r\nThe second article was written by writers at a nonprofit organization for 'interests in brain science, immunology, and arts education' whatever that means. All they did in that article is regurgitate ideas that a few neurobiologists had. Even with this seemingly reputable source they still didn&#039;t\r\n\r\n",

Let&#039;s see how far I can push your confirmation bias:\r\r\r\n\r\n [This article, which cites a study done by Lancet Medical Journal four years ago, says that moderate daily consumption of alcohol is good for you](http://www.epic4health.com/algoodforyou.html) \r\r\r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism even says that moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial to you.\r\r\r\n\r\nAll of the problems you&#039;re discussing stem from binge drinking regularly. If that point isn&#039;t clear to you: the problems you&#039;ve pointed out are only applicable to those who drink more than 5 drinks in one session several times a week. I know one person that does this and I don&#039;t associate with him.\r\r\r\n\r\nNow, if you&#039;ll excuse me, I have work to do as I am in school working toward providing myself with a respectable future.\r\n\r\n",

Whenever we get totally self-obesessed, we lose sight of so many other things.  I know ego is important for self-preservation, but mindless self-preservation seems to defeat the purpose of existence.  Life is so much larger than our momentary little experience of it, yet we fight and die for so many petty and trivial things.  Surely if there IS a point to living, it has to be larger and more important than our own precocious little egos.  In other words, I have to believe that having an ego is merely a means to an end, and by focusing on the means all the time, we completely lose sight of the end...\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "I watched Live Free or Die Hard last night.  It was fantastic.  Let&#039;s take a look at my list, and see what made it, shall we?\r\n\r\n\r\r\r'Yipee Kay Yay'  This token phrase made it in, of course.  I felt that used much better than the last two films, but it could never be as awesome as the first time.  This one was pretty obvious, so it&#039;s a bit of a freebie.\r\ra better ending than Die Hard with a Vengance  Live Free or Die Hard only got better and better as the movie went on, so the ending was the best part.  This was definitely a yes.\r\rJohn McClain has to fight a big German dude, who he ends up defeating using chains somehow. Lookout, though, because the German dude isn&#039;t actually dead.  This one wasn&#039;t perfect.  The bad guys weren&#039;t German, which was a disappointment.  John ends up fighting a small asian lady, which is just about the exact opposite of a big german dude.  However, it was extremely satisfying, and he did end up strangling her with elevator cables, which are pretty close to the chains he used in previous films.  Not perfect, but this one was fulfilled pretty well.\r\rMcClain shows his technophobia.  Like most things from Die Hard 2, this seems to have never actually happened.  I&#039;m content with going on like Die Hard 2 never happened.\r\rBonnie Bodelia as Holly Gennero.  She never appeared, so IMDB was correct.  However, they did show a picture of her, and John&#039;s daughter played a major part, so the same 'familial' themes were held together.\r\rReginald VelJohnson and Samuel L. Jackson both need to reprise their roles. They reall manned down on this one.  Neither of these guys were even mentioned, and it was a shame.  What is Reginald VelJohnson doing now anyway?\r\rThe enemy better be a group of German mercenary terrorists who all use MP5&#039;s for some reason.  As I said before, the bad guys were not German.  They were an odd mixture of american computer hackers and French mercenaries, a choice I will never understand.  They did not use MP5&#039;s, but rather went with much more realistic modified UMP rifles, with a very well placed MP7 showing up, as well.  McClain finally ditched his Baretta for a much lighter, more modern composite handgun.  No Steyer Augs, but that MP7 was way cooler, anyway.\r\rJohn McClain wears a white tank top.  McClain wore some sort of tan shirt, which pretty much started at the same color his shirts usually end at.  He still ended with a satisfying ammount of blood on him, though, so they held true to the McClain look.  I don&#039;t have a problem with Bruce Willis being completely bald this time around.  Willis, and by extension McClain, is becomming a very old dude.\r\rNumerous Christmas references.  Again, they totally manned down.  The movie didn&#039;t have a single Christmas reference.\r\r'Winter Wonderland'  Granted, this was a stupid thing to wish for.  No matter how 'Die Hard' this song is, nobody in their right mind would have it during the credits of an Independance Day film.  Still, it would have been nice.\r\r\r\n\r\nThere you have it.  The results weren&#039;t too bad at all, and I really enjoyed the movie.  I was not expecting much, but they really delivered.  This was very much a Die Hard movie, and it truly deserves the name.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nAnd for those of you waiting for a similar list for the Transformers movie, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll have to disappoint.  I&#039;ve made a lot of effort to learn everything I can about the movie, so I don&#039;t have a lot of unrealistic expectation.  Even still, my expectation is pretty high.\r\n\r\n",

A giant robot is PEEING on that bad guy! ROBOT PEE IS HILARIOUS!), the total misunderstanding about what the movie is about (the Autobots aren&#039;t really introduced until about an hour and a half into the movie, and even then they&#039;re just introduced; we never get to know them whatsoever. Also, the MAIN VILLAIN isn&#039;t formally introduced until the final half hour), the completely jumbled action sequences (I had no idea what the hell was going on in the final city battle), the gaping plotholes (what ever happened to the Mountain Dew-machine Transformer? Why in God&#039;s name do the parents not believe in Transformers when the Transformers completely annihilated most of the downtown area?!), or the extended parts that involved no Transformers and nothing to further advance the plot (anything involving Jon Voight and/or the 'hackers'), but I had a lot of ill-will in me after seeing Transformers.\r\rLuckily, the giant robots looked pretty awesome. And Shia LaBeouf was likable. Bumblebee was annoying and I can&#039;t imagine that anyone in the universe actually felt bad during his dramatic 'torture' sequence.\r\rAnd while I don&#039;t blame Bay&#039;s past failures or successes on this film, I do have to blame Bay for making a crappy movie this time around.

Indeed, the film had some serious problems.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nHowever, this review is not of the film.  No, this is a review of the review.  Indeed, the film was somewhat inadequate, but Jeffrey Westhoff&#039;s review of the film was disturbingly so.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nThat being said, all of Bralf&#039;s comments are valid.  Personally, I loved Michael Bay&#039;s The Island.  It isn&#039;t that sad to like a Michael Bay film, as long as it isn&#039;t Pearl Harbor\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "Well while we are talking about how people review movies. I really do not like it when someone sees something they don&#039;t like in a movie, then lets that feelings spill over into everything else in the movie. As humans, we do this all the time. I admit that sometimes I may not like the way a person wears their hair, so I assume I won&#039;t like them as a person at all. But you can&#039;t do this! For all I know that person is a rocket scientist or created the cell phone I&#039;m using.\r\n\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nBack to Transformers, however, Yes the Autobots were not introduced until really far in. And yes alot of the movie didn&#039;t have to do with Transformers, but the human race. The producers had to make a movie that EVERYONE would like, not just the Transformer enthusiasts. And to do that they had to add other aspects. I thought the whole attack on the human race was a good touch. It made me feel more into the movie. (The only Transformers I ever watched was the Beast Wars series). And I also hated parts of the movie. Some of the scenes that were added could have been removed completley and would not have left and plot out.\r\n\r\n \r\r\r\n\r\nBut I feel, Braft, that your spilling your bad feelings for some scenes over into the other parts of the movie. There are plenty of other movies that in the action scenes you can&#039;t follow anything. But I like that. The chaos is what makes you feel like your there and in the movie. (Which I think Bay did a godo job of, he did lots of angles that were shot up at the robots rather than looking down)  And if nothing you have to be impressed by the sheer CGI of Transforming robots. I mean I&#039;m sure that it was one guys job to animate Optimus primps left index fingers and nothing else!\r\n\r\n \r\r\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not saying you have to love the Movie Braft. Take a second, though, and remove the parts you didn&#039;t like of the movie and just watch the parts you liked. I bet you&#039;ll say wow that actually is an awesome movie.\r\n\r\n",

Most of your posts are about how no one likes you, how upset you are, how you dont have a friend in the world. And all this time up untill I saw that paragraph I thought 'what about me, I love you doesnt that count? What about our family dont they count?' then I saw that and now I know that we count alot. \r  You are our Jim Carry. You are every bit as funny as him. frome my point of veiw you are funnier because your jokes arnt written for you. I&#039;ve always been a little jelouse of you because you are the funny guy in the family. You always have a joke ready and you are not afrade to do or say something funnythat might make you look weird. But Im not so jelouse as I am unbelievably glad that you are my cousin because you always have a joke ready and you are not afrade to do or say something funny. You are what make going to Dan&#039;s so fun.\r  Im glad you found out how much us young&#039;ins look up to you. And you might have noticed that I look up to you a lot just by reading this, but I bet you didnt know that I look up to you more than any one I have ever known.\r\r  (P.S. This family already loves you more than any girlfriend ever could.)\r\n\r\n",

Everyone thinks that the filth is too systemic, that too many other people are doing the same thing, and so they feel no reason to do anything about it.

It&#039;s everybody&#039;s problem (EP), and you can&#039;t just refuse to deal with it because you don&#039;t think anybody else will. It&#039;s very easy to say, 'well, nobody else is going to do anything about their filth, so who cares if I don&#039;t, either.' It&#039;s also pretty easy to empty and clean out cups and bottles before you throw them away, crush empty boxes to save space, try to dispose of nasty organic matter in alternate ways, and not just leave a bag of trash in the stairwell of your apartment building for weeks at a time. Sure, one small person may not make a difference, but you could at least have a very legitimate reason to feel superior to other people, which could certainly go a long way.\r\n\r\n*Refuse the refuse*?\r\n\r\n",

Oh, and I was walking by said alley last night, and I was getting ready to throw away an empty coffee cup I had just finished, and there was another cup full of liquid that someone had just left on the bench.

Sometimes it seems like we&#039;re all supposed to be divided into two camps: those 'realists' who are Mr. Grumpy Negatives or those Pollyannas whoclaim all is sweetness and light while the world is crumbling. \r\n\r\nBut nothing is ever that black or white, of course. There are good things and bad things, and sometimes bad can be good and good can be bad. That&#039;s probably why these photos are so evocative--they compel us to reconsider those definitions. All that trash seems bad. But it is a result of our pleasant modern lifestyle, which is good. But such reckless disregard for the environment is bad. But the fact that someone noticed and we all want to do the 'right thing' is good. But what is 'the right thing'? And how do we do it? And what if we do the wrong thing by mistake? Worse yet, what if we do nothing? But who are we to *do* something? Aren&#039;t there smarter people out there than we are, and shouldn&#039;t we let *them* do what needs to be done? Besides, don&#039;t we all have plenty of other problems to take care of? I know I sure as hell do.\r\n\r\nSo you see, 'fan,' I don&#039;t think you should apologize for your posting. We&#039;re all in this together, and don&#039;t none of us know what&#039;s right or good or even worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nMan, these pictures really make you think . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

No one really cared who you were, and you sure didn&#039;t have to explain yourself to anyone. Now, I am encouraged to feel inadequate in the face of others&#039; expectations, when I am actually what I should be: capable AND fun. This adult world of ours takes all the humor and light-heartedness out of life, and I say it&#039;s nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nAlso, I grunt every time I bend topick something up and beer has lost much of its solo appeal, requiring a meal or hors d&#039;oeuvres to suffice. I also know how to spell hors d&#039;oeuvres without looking it up in the dictionary. These arequalities no young man should possess.\r\n\r\n",

You may think it&#039;s a dense, built up area around Southport and along Ashland but that&#039;s peanuts to Manhattan. Even the area between North and Diversey, considered the densest part of Chicago, pales in comparison to Manhattan. 2.8 million is also closer to the population of Brooklyn, with NYC as a whole a lot bigger. So just think of yourself in a really big suburb, but a cool kind because you don&#039;t need a car and there are more hot babes. And you can get food at any hour of the night, delivered to your doorstep.\r\n\r\nRemember: You&#039;ve made the exact opposite decision of nearly everyone in the country for the past 30 years, you&#039;ve moved into a densely populated urban area in the Midwest.

      "text": "First of all, I want to say that the previous commenter was not me. I would not say 'listen to your mom,' because that would be the best way I can think of to make sure you would not listen to me. So, beware of imposters posing as your mother! (That&#039;s probably good advice for anyone.)\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I just recently defrosted my freezers and took the opportunity to inventory my food supplies. Since the data I derived dovetails nicely with your shopping trip, I thought you might be interested.\r\n\r\nI currently have the following items I&#039;ve grown and frozen:\r\n\r\n60 pints peas; 102 pints green beans, 74 pints corn, 64 pints broccoli, 14 pints green peppers, 9 pints spinach, 20 quarts dried beans, 74 pints tomato sauce, 19 quarts tomato sauce, 30 pints soup, 24 quarts soup, 9 pints salsa, 1 quart salsa, 4 quarts tomato juice, 16 quarts grape and cherry juice, 3 quarts blueberries, 3 quarts strawberries, and 3 pints cranberries (the blueberries and cranberries are not from my garden, but I hope they soon will be). \r\n\r\nIn addition, I anticipate harvesting at least 3 bushels of potatoes, 3 bushels of sweet potatoes, and multiple more pints of celery, sauce, soup, and salsa. (Knock on wood with the potatoes--anything can still happen!) Keep in mind, too, I net at least 3 dozen eggs a week for six months of the year, giving me 78 dozen eggs, about half of which I sell. I am also not counting the multiple bushels of lettuce we harvest each year (gotta be at least 10 bushels!) and the quantities of herbs, hot peppers, etc. \r\n\r\nWhile none of this is exactly cost-free because the seeds cost money and I&#039;ve paid for tools, etc., and, of course, if you factor in my time the cost really goes up, but the point is that it costs nothing in terms of shipping or sales mark-up and it is as pure as food can be these days, being fertilized solely by poop from my chicken and goat friends. \r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m not suggesting everyone should grow all their own food, but I do think that anyone who can grow ANYTHING, should do so whenever possible. After all, the element we haven&#039;t even factored into the cost/benefit analysis is the karmic cost of buying crap at the store. I have to believe that when you kill a life form with your own two hands and immediately consume it, you are racking up much less of a karmic debt than you do when you allow someone else to do your killing for you. I am confident that because I know my tomatoes are going to turn into me, I take greater care of them while they are alive and I slaughter them with greater respect than any commercial grower can muster. \r\n\r\nOf course, that line of thinking goes way off in a completely different direction than a simple shopping trip . . .\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n",

And story wise, there isn&#039;t anything revolutionary going on. But I agree with what you said about Cameron using cliches. He used them because it makes the story simple and will appeal to the widest audience possible. He did revolutionary things with visual effects, absolutely, but chose to keep the story as simple as a childrens&#039; movie. And that&#039;s totally okay. I think you can have a great movie with simple effects and a complex story or complex effects and a simple story.\r\n\r\nBut I would only call a movie a masterpiece if it did both.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "Okay, so last night I was coming in from the goat pen, and as I was walking up the walkway to the porch, I saw Bartley lying in the grass there. As I walked by, he did not jump in front of me as he usually does, but rolled over and exposed his belly in a very alluring way, begging me to pet him. I thought, 'Oh, he&#039;s finally turning cute!' And I petted him on the head, and scratched his chin and . . . then I thought, 'Didn&#039;t you used to have more white fur?' I looked at him as I was petting him, while he was writhing around happily, and I was just SURE he used to have more white fur on his belly and his face. I looked at his face, and his eyes were the right color and his nose had that bump in it like it always has, so I thought, 'Wow, I must be getting Alzheimery. I really thought he had more white on him.' Then I turned around to go up the step AND THERE WAS BARTLEY!!!!! The cat I had been petting was someone else altogether, and Bartley was PISSED!\r\n\r\nI ran to the door and yelled for Bob to come outside because something weird was going on. He came out and I showed him this new cat, who was a dead ringer for Bartley, except for the amount of white fur and the fact that the new guy still has all his original equipment. I was showing Bob how nice this new cat was by petting him when all of a sudden he attacked me, biting and scratching my arm, which put Bartley in motion, which put Not-Bartley in motion too. They both ended up in the driveway, rolling around like lions, howling and swishing their tails furiously. They ended up spending about ten minutes just howling at each other, during which time I&#039;m pretty sure they were talking about me. I&#039;m confident the new guy is Bartley&#039;s brother, who must live around the corner. He seemed very well-fed and well groomed, so I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t get rabies, but you never know. \r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t seen either Bartley or not-Bartley today, but I&#039;ve had a raccoon raiding the bird-feeder all day, in spite of the fact that it&#039;s full-on daylight and 150 degrees.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s always exciting around here . . .\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n",

The neighbors apartment, perhaps. After that, we preemptively took your advice to tangle them together for later.

So whether people wander around an open map, or kill monsters non-stop they are wasting time in both cases. \r\n\r\n\nIt depends on what a player enjoys. Some people (me for ex) do enjoy walking around from place to place with only occasional action. When theres non-stop action, i get bored easily because its the same thing over and over again. When action is sporadic, its new and refreshing each time. \r\n\r\n\nI would conclude that the Skyrim model is the best, where it gives you an option to fast travel but ONLY to familiar places. Im playing Morrowind now though, and i dont mind the traveling.\r\n\r\n\n",

When I ate the dessert, I had some sort of yucky, repulsive, foreign taste in my mouth.  I  thought it was just the odd mixture of ingredients for that dessert.
